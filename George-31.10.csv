My Plan D from Social Security more than doubled in cost to me for the year 2023.  And we received nearly 6% SSA increase.  Underwhelming.  But we are lucky in that our costs otherwise are mostly fixed with paid off car and 2.25% 30 year mortgage.  Our stock investment plus our other two paid off homes combine for 7 figures which is not bad for a kid from the Appalican mountains 73 years ago.  My forecast is neither gloom and doom or rosy with rainbows.  It is what it is.  When one prepares one need not worry."

141,Patrick Ceresna (How Gold Investors Can Use Options To Increase Gains/Lower Risk),S. Armstrong,"If any asset drops 50% (ie. 100 down to 50), inevitably needs a 100% increase to get back to the original price (50 to 100). That is not a good way to look the asset because the asset might not get back to its original price. Options that fall out-of-the-money can drop 80% quickly because of Gamma but needs 150% gain to get back to break-even. Options are not good for beginners without knowing the greeks. Spreads work better (supplementing stock positions) for beginners and focusing on overbought and oversold for entry points would work better than outright options. Selling naked puts or calls is way more risky because you not only can lose 100&#39;s more than you could have made, but rolling out losing options with create wash sales that affect negatively on taxes. Be carful people.<br>PS. He did not show you the problem of his max loss curve. the is a time theta (time value) that creates a curve not a straight line."

243,"Tim Staermose (Frontier Investing, Cheap Asset,, Emerging Markets, Huge Dividend Opportunities)",Jarred Zachariah,"&lt;I respect your work mate, because you are pointing people in the right direction. If there is one thing I have learned in recent months, it is to remain calm, especially when it comes to investments in cryptocurrencies. Learn not to sell in a panic when everything goes down and not to buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise y&#39;all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.The market is very unstable and you can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s going bearish or bullish.While myself and others are trad!n without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow. I was able to make 6 BTC from 2.1 BTC in just August from implementing trades with tips and info from Tony Max."

It really doesn&#39;t matter whether one is trading soy futures, silver, stocks or cryptocurrencies. Markets generally move in cycles, which can last from a few days to a couple of years. In B -TC’s case, it&#39;s hard for anyone to justify a bullish case by looking at the chart. It is much more complicated than some would have you believe but from Tony Max approach, bear market aren’t worth losing from if you use the ongoing new bie/investor programs.

424,Emil Kalinowski (The Banking Crisis Nobody Is Talking About: Deep Dive),Nathan Brady,"I enjoyed Emil&#39;s analysis very much, but to an Austrian it all sounds a little silly. The macro economist sees accelerating a fall past 150 mph as an early warning indicator that you will soon fatally crash into the ground. The Austrian sees the cliff you jumped off of."
425,Emil Kalinowski (The Banking Crisis Nobody Is Talking About: Deep Dive),Nick Steele,"I wonder if China&#39;s dismantling of the situation with Evergrande is a bit more thoughtful, deliberate, and even more in a &quot;capitalist sort of method&quot; than we were using in the 2008 and 2020 market crashes. My first thought in 2008 and 2020 was that I  hope we as a country  don&#39;t try to save businesses that are hurt in the downturns. I think the capitalist way,  like Adam Smith might have thought, would be to let them fail until the best are left standing. Businesses can make people rich or perhaps very rich. Why should the Fed or we as a country do anything to help particular businesses, even big banks. The Fed and our elected leaders should just be there to make sure money flows and not try to dictate how and where it flows. Jamie Dimon looks to me like a suck-up to the Fed, getting rich on the Feds (American Peoples) balance sheet...lol.  Big Banks have never had it better than in the last couple decades and it shows in our national debt. Did you read today that they are worried about being able to raise Social Security for retired people to keep up with inflation. What a failure our country is becoming....sad"

I&#39;ve personally been to both Colombia and Mexico and while they technically have DUI laws usually all one has to do is pay a small fine on the spot and they can be on there way and there&#39;s actually less accidents in these countries than in America, figure that."

658,How Evergrande And China Could Collapse The Global Economy!!,Bernard Watts,"Re: repayment of loans and interest with less currency than the original loan. You said that high velocity (speed) of money flow would allow a person to repay a loan with less currency than the original loan. This may be incorrect as to rapy the loan it is an acceleration of money flow rather than speed that is needed as this would lead to money reaching the borrower faster than he is repaying the loan. However, this implies inflation, which is why he repays the loan painlessly."

669,How Evergrande And China Could Collapse The Global Economy!!,Jonathon Ray,"1. Global debt based economy - meaning that money and prosperity is created by debt more than by productivity - especially so in the west - but chinas debts are a problem too.<br>2. Interest rates are low to service the debts.<br>3. This creates an incentive to get into debt, which creates an incentive to buy assets with debt, which creates an asset inflation spiral if only purely on the basis of the increasing prices from debt-based consumer demand. Essentially the debt based economy creates a risk-on environment as in the game of monopoly (buy everything - or you will lose).<br>4. This asset inflation eventually spills over into all asset classes as people attempt to mitigate risk and avoid bubbles.<br>5. This inevitably causes consumer price inflation.<br>6. This is a scenario where the allocation of resources is based on mania for keeping up with the debt, and not for productivity and the health of the community.<br>7. This means that the situation will be like china’s ghost towns and Russia’s centralised programs - the allocation of resources doesn’t go to where it needs leading to security, health, food, energy, poverty, crises. This will combine with the above debt based incentives to either a collapse through a series of defaults or to a complete inflation cycle through fear and scarcity (even if there is plenty of productivity in building china’s ghost towns).<br>8. Both these scenarios are super risky and bad for governments and social cohesion so at this point governments will need to “do something”. That something will be either totalitarian, extreme austerity, hyperinflation, the new money order or war. Or any combination of the above."
670,How Evergrande And China Could Collapse The Global Economy!!,Frank Blangeard,The United States has been taken over by revolutionary authoritarians who are supposedly leading us into a socialist utopia.

If the law is massively unethical then ethically unethical law must be violated if one is going to live an ethical life.  Now some may say with some justification that ethics ends at the barrel of a gun.  But we must NEVER uphold law as more important than ethics.
748,Judge Napolitano (Mandates And The Constitution...Deep Dive),Samantha Atkins,I disagree with the Judge on some things but this is EXCELLENT and and excellent interview and exploration of the topic as well.  Very impressive!
749,Judge Napolitano (Mandates And The Constitution...Deep Dive),Samantha Atkins,"There is ample evidence that COVID vaccines will not ever do something many in government keep claiming which is completely wipe out COVID-19.  There is ample evidence they do not protect to becoming infected with some variant or other.  Which should be expected for any coronavirus (e.g., flu).   So much of the supposed reason is without merit.  Also if the vaccines worked then the unvaccinated are not a threat to the vaccinated."
750,Judge Napolitano (Mandates And The Constitution...Deep Dive),Samantha Atkins,claiming a fetus is a human being in the sense of having full human rights is mere opinion and cannot be objectively determined.  So arguing for vaccine mandates by application of pro-life arguments is both poor analogical reasoning.

Being 64 I came out of high school in 1976 with very, very few good paying job opportunities, plus inflation was eating away from any job available. I ended up going to school and then taking a job at $825 per month in 1979 and after one year got a 11% raise while inflation was 11.5%. Those times were depressing and scary at the same time. The thing we lacked was hope for the future. Then Ronald Reagan and Paul Volker came along sand brought us that.  I would like to have the guys talk about all the job opportunities currently and how they are going to disappear in the near future when massive inflation and then stagflation takes over."

The other thing he’s wrong about is the inflation is supply side. It is not sustained inflation. Yes it will be around for awhile because supply is severely disrupted, but to get sustained yearly inflation you need significant growth in wages and less debt. Now I do believe we will see sustained inflation, but not until we get a deflationary bust"

Those cracks are much worse when I travel to areas that have never recovered from the GFC. I don&#39;t know what kind of rose colored glasses you guys are wearing, but there is no recovery.

That seems only to apply if you are Not a covered Expat or a company/income producing venture but as for someone who&#39;s net worth is an IRA, It does not matter unless you are worried about a Wealth Tax...

That tends to make economic demands on the cerebral cortex function. In particular, it tends to move resources away from high-level complex critical thinking tasks to low-level thinking tasks like anxiety resolution.

That could explain the disparity in the narrative between the emerging science of vaccine efficacy vs. natural immunity and the relentless get-jabbed official narrative being jammed down our throats.<br>           Biden just stood in front of the UN and committed US tax dollars to fund the vaccination of the underprivileged around the entire planet.<br>            God forbid all of the scaling up these vaccine producers did for this pandemic was to become unnecessary.

1003,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Charles Schwer,"We are hearing now that inflation is good for the economy. I think this is a lie and I think I know the reason for this lie. There are two types of deflation. There is a deflation the reduces demand for goods and services and there is a deflation that comes from better technology, efficiency, and effectiveness. The economists fight these two deflations as though they are one and the same. This global fighting of deflation and the printing of money sorta the cause of the new normal, the government response to covid.<br><br>I must be a right wing conspiracy guy to think there is some connection between the government response to covid (the new normal) and the global quest to find relief from too much debt without doing any deleveraging. But I do. We know that free trade and technology is deflationary and governments are on a quest to stop deflation by any means necessary and create inflation to underwrite their debt. Also economic effectiveness in the economy is also deflationary. These three (free trade, technology, and effectiveness) make the connection between the new normal and too much debt. The quest to find relief from too much debt is the connection between the new normal and this global printing of money.<br><br>This is why I say the global quest of monetary assets (including government sovereign debt) is to find relief from too much debt without deleveraging. And that is the cause of the new normal, the government&#39;s response to covid."

1008,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Danny,"Ever since life first developed and evolved on earth, all life has had to compete for survival. Ever since humans started to dominate life on earth, they too had to compete for survival. There has also been a tendency for humans to compete in trying to conquer, dominate and control other humans and get them to be servants and slaves. Using force including beating, torture and killing to compete is also something that humans have had a tendency to do. To help them achieve these goals, humans tend to organize themselves into groups such as tribes, communities, societies, kingdoms, empires, dynasties and nations along with organizations and associations and yes even gangs with a hierarchy and ranking level structure of command such as corporations and political parties. Humans have also created caste and class systems and have an amazing talent to tell fascinating and conflicting creation stories with an equal amazing ability or,  should I say weakness, to believe the stories which have also been used to conquer, dominate and control other humans sometimes for the better but often times for the worse and to justify bad behaviors such as slavery and genocide. <br><br>For most humans, life has always been a struggle and a competition for survival. If there is any chance for humans to live on earth in fair and peaceful ways without abusing, killing or dominating each other and destroying earth’s environment in the process, humans will have to learn that: conquering, killing, oppressing, discriminating  and enslaving other humans along with, stealing, cheating, lying, spying, deception, greed, betrayal including violence, coercion, extortion, corruption are never beneficial in the long run.  Humans also will need to learn and understand that the wellbeing of others benefits everyone and is the basis for morality and that reason, rationality, logic, honesty, trust and responsibility are the best ways we know of so far to live in peace and fairness.<br><br>The idea of democracy with systems of law, order and justice also need to be encouraged and promoted and when trying to learn and understand the nature of things and solve problems the scientific method needs to be embraced. I am hoping that the explosion of information technologies like the internet can help and inspire all human life on earth to live together in fair, peaceful and sustainable ways. Unfortunately information technologies like the internet can also make it easier to spread false and fake information along with bad ideas to help inspire division and hatred against other humans, other cultures, or other nations."

Crypto is moving with little sign of stopping throughout the past few days and weeks, with movements reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin&#39;s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. I believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why it&#39;s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Mr. Rick Richard , who is a signal provider."

1021,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Roberto Manca,"I draw the line in the sand where the state is asking me to do or not to do something that only affects me, my own health or whatever that is only my own business. When I&#39;m asked not to do something because it may (or surely will) affect other people&#39;s health or whatever well being, then that&#39;s only living in a civilized society, so I agree that I shouldn&#39;t smoke in public places, that I shouldn&#39;t go into such places without a mask and without being vaccinated for a virus that&#39;s killing people and I may be carrying it and spreading it or picking it up in such places and in turn spread it myself. If bars, restaurants are opening to the public and are able to stay in business is because the majority of people agreed to be vaccinated and most of them don&#39;t think it&#39;s either fair or safe to let unvaccinated people join in and mix in the crowd.  It&#39;s not in principle very different from understanding that I shouldn&#39;t drink and drive or for HIV positive people to warn their sexual partners about their condition. You can&#39;t just talk about freedoms without talking about your duties. Why don&#39;t you argue that you want your freedom to drink and drive or your freedom to drive at 120mph anywhere you like or your freedom to infect others with HIV because you want to have your freedom to enjoy unprotected sex without telling your partner you got HIV? Because you&#39;re arguing the same thing when you argue that you want to be free to carry your Delta virus (because you may be carrying it without knowing it) and spread it around to others, some of whom may die as a consequence. This virus keeps developing new variant when it&#39;s let loose among a population, it&#39;s already happened in the UK, in SA and in India and we&#39;re all paying the consequences of that globally. What is your position going to be if a newer variant, let&#39;s say &#39;Omega&#39; that kills people within 3 days with no chance of survival appears and spreads 20 times faster than any seen before?"

1138,Could A Civil War Trigger Next Economic Collapse?,Dan X,"Love your stuff, George, but here you are missing something fundamental. Red is mostly countryside and suburbs. Blue is mostly cities. The countryside can do without the cities, but cities cannot exist without the countryside. Cities depend upon the countryside for food, water, electricity, and transport. If the cities magically vanished, the countryside would recreate them in a generation or two. But the opposite is not true. If the countryside magically vanished, the cities would die in a few weeks. You can argue this from a GDP standpoint as well. Separate the two economies. The rural economy has a food and shelter surplus, carries less debt, and is therefore less vulnerable to a drop in rural GDP.  The city economy is a debt ridden house of cards, with those cards linked to global supply chains. Key point, this basic reality has been true for the past 5000 years."

Franklin made trip after trip to Britain to find a peaceful solution. Nobody wanted war, and no body wanted to separate. It was only the intransigence of the British which resulted in the war. It was not the &quot;Patriotism&quot; of the Americans which brought about the war. <br><br>Secondly - you are quick to condemn government mandates when they appear to come from the Democrats, but somehow you are forgetful when the Republicans impose mandates - for example, mandates against school districts, prohibiting masks.

1181,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",ADAM REES,"This is the second time I’ve listened to this guy. If you take the words “capitalism” and “socialism” and set them aside. Then ask the question, which do you want: the government to own the means of production or the people to own the means of production. This guy would agree that the people should own the means of production. He is a capitalist. I agree with the concepts he describes. And the funniest part of the interview is that literally nothing is stopping anyone from doing what he’s saying. Including him.

1183,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",ADAM REES,"@Duck Duck Go interesting. Especially the part where you claim to have looked up nothing  (which is admission of a failure), but already know (which is almost always an egotistical statement as if any of us truly ‘know’) and then claim I have a side and that the side I’m on makes a poor argument when I’m not arguing, which is quite humorous considering you have been arguing yet haven’t made any points. To be clear it’s humorous because this is such a socialist way. If socialists could only see themselves. Anyway, as I’ve said all along, keep going and stay curious."

Some people are just better than other people.  It&#39;s not the government or the economic system that creates the winners and losers in life....
1188,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",Duck Duck Go,"​@Pulsar Lights I didn&#39;t mention anything about immunity against corruption or everything being socially owned. I mentioned stronger mitigation against concentrated wealth and power, two key catalysts of corruption. I also talked about the economy being socially owned. That doesn&#39;t amount to everything being socially owned, just the bulk of the economy. It is common sense that if power is less centralised, spread more and properly accountable, there will be less scope for corruption. Moreover, interests will be more aligned in a shared economy based on cooperation, rather than a segregated economy based on competition and class conflict, so there will be fewer economic incentives attracting corruption.<br><br>There are no fully fledged democratic socialist governments in existence, but this is an ambition of socialists. Nevertheless, one sees aspects of democratic socialist practises, in both social and liberal democracies, such as civil liberties, worker co-operatives, publicly owned companies, publicly owned resources/industries, publicly owned institutions, public investment, worker representation on company boards, universal healthcare, universal further/higher education, public housing projects, citizen assemblies, sortition practises etc.<br><br>At the moment, we are in a long period of transition from capitalism to socialism, much like the preceding transition from feudalism to capitalism. However, capitalism still predominates and subsequently continues to cause many of the negative outcomes people experience. Unfortunately, human progress tends to move slowly."
1189,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",Pulsar Lights,@Duck Duck Go Do you have an example of a democratic socialist government immune to corruption and everything is socially owned?
1190,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",Duck Duck Go,"​@Pulsar Lights A democratic socialist government is very different from a capitalist government, given that concentrated wealth and power are mitigated under the former, but not the latter.<br><br>The problem with government under capitalism, is that concentrated wealth captures it and uses it to shape the system to serve its interests, which are not the interests of the majority of people. Subsequently, it becomes another arena of class warfare between capitalists and workers, where workers are outgunned. That can&#39;t happen in a democratic socialist system, where the means of production are socially owned, and democracy is mandated in the economy, as well as the political institutions.<br><br>Furthermore, there are administrative methods of democracy that can be used, which are far more robust against unbridled power than existing methods under capitalist systems, such as the use of sortition and citizen assemblies."
1191,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",Pulsar Lights,"@Duck Duck Go Of course a government is the best entity to control &quot;power and authority over resources&quot; because you just never see corruptions in many governments, especially those with absolute power..."

His idea is basically make a more participative free market capitalism (although he would disagree with this term). But that already exists in two different and practical forms: 1) cooperatives and 2) stocks. I like the fact that more socialists are finally getting to the point. They are a VERY SLOW crew.
1200,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",John Griffiths,U must be kidding.  A life long professor thinks it’s so easy to simply start a successful business.   Using the Economic powerhouse of Italy as his co-op success story. Typical professor living in his ivory tower bubble.

1202,"Richard Wolff (Marxism Deep Dive, Socialism vs. Capitalism, A Solution To Corporatism)",Anthony Harris,"Even though I disagree with I really enjoy listening to Dr. Wolff. The problem I have with his examples is that he talks likes co-ops are viable alternatives to the current system. If they were more productive/efficient then we would see them all over the place. Alas, they are not, and if we were to have a mass change where all businesses became co-ops we would see a slower rate of growth/innovation and more than likely experience significant economic contraction. The beauty of the current system (monetary policy excluded) is that Dr. Wolff&#39;s ideas can compete with current business structure. The fact that there are so few of them shows that they are loosing."

This is because if the higher ups in a company have an equal vote to the mass employees in a company then the employees would win every time. For example, if there was a vote done in corporation XYZ about raising wages the employees would win. If wages were dramatically increased we would have mass inflation!"

Next they changed the laws giving most rights to the tenants and making it difficult to move them on(easier to sell if you have difficult tenants). A few months ago they removed interest as a expense, this is a large expense not to be able to claim. Lots of landlords have sold up already with the state buying them.

1321,Billionaire Makes Shocking Prediction About The Dollar's Demise,Comment 22,"I wish people would stop talking about &quot;stimi&quot; checks as if they&#39;re still a factor with what&#39;s going on with the economy, because they&#39;re NOT. As I have to keep saying, the last stimulus checks were sent out last December and whatever people were going to do with them has been done. The money from those checks have been spent, saved, or used to pay down debt, so George please stop referring to them as if they are still being mailed out. As for those relatively few who may still be waiting for their stimulus check, it&#39;s too little too late for any spending from those checks to make any significant difference in boosting economic activity"
1322,Billionaire Makes Shocking Prediction About The Dollar's Demise,Comment 22,"@bpiilani okay, thanks."
1323,Billionaire Makes Shocking Prediction About The Dollar's Demise,bpiilani,@Comment 22 You obviously missed my point. You said he should stop bringing up the stimulus checks but I was pointing out that the stimulus checks are still wreaking havoc not to mention the other stimuli. I know they are artificial. That’s why I brought them up.
1324,Billionaire Makes Shocking Prediction About The Dollar's Demise,Comment 22,"@bpiilani None of those things result in sustainable economic growth, they provide for a false high, as in high on some type of drug, in this case cheap money, that makes the economy and GDP look good. Rent moratoriums, child tax credits, infrastructure spending, &quot;enhanced&quot; unemployment benefits etc., are all different forms of ARTIFICIAL stimuli too that when circulated throughout the economy mimics economic growth. None of this nonsense is lost on those who are wise and hip to the Wall Street/Fed casino-like games and tricks."
1325,Billionaire Makes Shocking Prediction About The Dollar's Demise,bpiilani,"Whether those checks are in savings or paying down debt, there are second and third order affects. First, the money is now in circulation (ongoing - not destroyed). Second, any debt paid off created room to increase that debt back, ie., even more money into circulation. Third, rental moratorium freed up a lot of additional cash that chases after goods and services rather than lodging. Next, child tax credits and other tax credits, again, cash chasing additional goods and services. Supplemental unemployment was also an additional driver to get more cash into circulation. And lastly, the Government is about to put another Trillion into the economy with the infrastructure bill. Tether this to the twin deficit architecture and it becomes a death spiral. You think the infrastructure bill is the last of Government spending?  You think the bank repos won’t keep going up?  You think the Feds balance sheet won’t keep going up?  You think the stock market is going to allow that?  The effect of the original stimulus spending has lasting and correlating effects that ripple through the economy and compound the downside."

1465,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Danny,"Why would you want to keep dollars? If you had to sweat doing physical labour for 8 to 10 hours a day to earn those dollars or even if you just had to work hard not doing physical labour,  you will be much more protective and reserved about parting with those dollars regardless if you just spend them or invest them in the stock market.  The easy part is spending your money and I would even say it is easy to invest your money. The hard part is earning your money or getting a return on your investment.  I am old enough to remember during the last century when the  Italian immigrants would go buy their groceries or other items they needed, they would ask “quanti dollori”.  For those that do not know Italian, “quanti dollori”  means “how much pain”.  The word pain in Italian sounds similar to dollars, hence the pun on the word dollar."

1473,LIVE STREAM Q&A,George Gammon,"The problem with discussing these topics is they&#39;re incredibly nuanced. It&#39;s very similar to discussing inflation. Unless you understand the underlying science or concepts it&#39;s easy to misjudge it at surface level. I can assure you everything Rich and Rollo discuss about the dynamics between men and women is backed up by decades of research. And when you truly get to the bottom of it, the message is not &quot;bashing&quot; but empowerment of both sexes. As I&#39;ve done with my 2 nieces, I&#39;d suggest reading the &quot;Rational Male.&quot; I think the book is just as valuable for women as it is for men. Women and men aren&#39;t identical, we&#39;re different and compliment one another, that&#39;s a good thing not a bad thing."

1475,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Lyssa G.,"@George Gammon I never said it was derogatory, just the fact that you mentioned it more than once is enough. I do apologize for saying anything about your father. So you do read comments 😉"
1476,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Courtney Smith,"@George Gammon I will elaborate (I am at work right now but I will do my best). I respect so much of your research, but it’s the chats with entrepreneurs in cars group. I think there are a lot of generalizations about women wanting men seeking excellence, and adopting more masculine roles in regards to careers. For example, I lived in Scottsdale for 10 years, and bartended at a Mastro’s Ocean Club through college. I saw a lot of what you were discussing with the Entrepreneurs inn Cars guy. However, that’s a very different dynamic than how women behave in Maryland, where I was raised and currently live  (near DC). So it really depends on social norms, regions, etc. within the U.S. (I believe). I think there is more to it than saying that women want the kind of man that doesn’t exist (bc of so many betas). I am a single mom raising a son. I don’t surround him with women, which is another stereotype in my opinion (I realize I might be an outlier). I would just like to see more hard and fast research on all of this. It’s a fascinating topic. All I am saying is the commentary wasn’t exactly painting women or single moms in a great light. If the research is there to back it up, then fair enough. I appreciate your work, and all you do to educate us George, I mean that. 🙏"

1490,"Erik Townsend (Inflation Deep Dive, Could Oil Price Skyrocket? Future Of CBDC vs Crypto)",veritasfiles,"I think Erik Townsend is largely correct, though I would say that our ability to pin down the timing on the &quot;inevitable collapse&quot; of the system is virtually ZERO, and so there is NEVER a time when one would want to be without a significant stock of Gold &amp; Silver.  I don&#39;t do these low 1, 3, 10, 20, or even 30% allocations that are often recommended because these low percentages have more to do with your total amount of wealth and long-term wealth desires than they do what you should really be holding in the face of an inevitable collapse whose timing you cannot predict.  So if I have a total net worth of $10,000, I would never say that someone should only hold $1,000 to $3,000 of that in Gold &amp; Silver.  I would tell them to hold most or all of that amount in Gold &amp; Silver.  It&#39;s not until I&#39;m holding 5 to 10 X the average income of someone in the middle class that I would even consider dropping my allocation under the 90% mark.  After 10 X, I&#39;d start dropping it slowly, as my wealth continued to accumulate.  But 95% of the people listening to the advice of people like Erik Townsend or Jim Rickards aren&#39;t anywhere near that number, so I think that most of the &quot;average guys on the street&quot; are massively under invested in &quot;real money&quot; even if they are of the Gold/Silver bug persuasion.  I think Erik Townsend&#39;s chronological snobbery with regard to digital currency relative to something like old like Gold &amp; Silver boils down mostly to his being enamored with the technological and the new rather than having a sound understanding of the nature/essence of money itself.  I get that he&#39;s hopeful about what human beings can do an achieve with these new amazing technologies that are so in their infancy that they &quot;haven&#39;t even begun yet&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily translate into a successful reality.  Sometimes there are simply natural laws that don&#39;t go away.  They can&#39;t be legislated away, and they can&#39;t be erased by clever technological advances, which is precisely what fractional reserve banking and paper currencies were.  People felt very much like Townsend when those things were created, but detaching themselves from &quot;real money&quot; and the recognition of the nature/essence of &quot;real money&quot; simply because humans had come up with something more clever didn&#39;t ever really change the nature of money.  Eventually, you have to come back into contact with reality to move forward on a sound basis.  Townsend 100% correct about oil &amp; gas and the prices that we&#39;ll end up paying.  Even without taking inflation into account, I would not be surprised to see prices being at 10 X from where they are today, and that will devastate massive areas of the global economy.  Hopefully, they&#39;ll wake up to this premature cutoff of investment in the energy space because it won&#39;t be a pretty picture, if they don&#39;t.  Great interview!"

The economy in real terms is shrinking in the west. Your guests keep calling the collapsing economy deflationary. Meanwhile if you have monetary inflation while the economy is collapsing it exaggerates the inflation. Asset prices may still collapse during inflation and infact in real terms they have in other nations experiencing hyperinflation. The only things new here is reserve status of USD and unison with other nations also inflating... this is leading to either global government or a massive war imo...

Doesn’t matter who he is. You determine your life. It’s true. And then a few months later he posted about Biden wanting to raise the capital gains to 40% or something. I responded it doesn’t matter who the president is since you determine your life, but the president can have a big impact in some aspects. It’s why the veto is so powerful. But now we got democrats controlling everything that may pass things even without Republicans vote in the senate in the budget reconciliation or whatever loophole they’re using. If Biden signs off on universal basic income that’s going to have a big effect. If trump was in office they’d know they don’t have a prayer in hell.

If The Allies would have accepted their currency and not demand gold, there would not have been the hyperinflation. The farmers did great because their assets (crops) appreciated, at least until the government stole it. When we go into the next war then it might be a good analogy.

1639,"Rich Cooper (Red Pill Dynamics, Entrepreneurship, Chase Excellence, How To Be ""High Value"")",Some Guy,Every young man needs to hear about the red pill. Spread the word.  My life would have been way easier if I heard about it in high school.
1640,"Rich Cooper (Red Pill Dynamics, Entrepreneurship, Chase Excellence, How To Be ""High Value"")",J R,"Interesting conversation but why this burning need of validation to call oneself an Alpha male.  Just be a man, make your dent in the world not with words but with your actions. Why be a slave to the thought of having to prove to the world you’re an alpha."
1641,"Rich Cooper (Red Pill Dynamics, Entrepreneurship, Chase Excellence, How To Be ""High Value"")",Lee Kyu,TRT is good....but you are down regulting your own T production.  So becareful.

1643,"Rich Cooper (Red Pill Dynamics, Entrepreneurship, Chase Excellence, How To Be ""High Value"")",Jez Pen,"Our 25 year marriage truly has traditional roles, although, I’ve always worked (p/t) and made more money (I’m an RN), our roles are traditional. He’s our main provider, working 40 hours plus a week, and I did 70% to 90% of the child rearing when our children were little, cooking and cleaning, volunteering at our childrens’ school, helping them with homework, etc. He’s not lazy, he’s moral and ethical, he works hard and as the kids grew older he really took over a lot of the child care in regards to teaching our sons and our daughter about life, how to behave, being independent, fixing cars, house maintenance, coaching basketball, etc. It’s made him really close to them. He has earned all of our respect by his example of how to be a man. I’d also like to say that we are both rooted in our faith which dictates tradition and sacrifice. I know not a lot of believers in God out there but true Christianity is traditional in male/female roles, which, in my experience, works. Too many wild women these days and that’s not good. Good luck and God bless you all 😊"

Snap out of it. <br><br>And I agree with most of what this guy is saying, Just no need to look at things in absolute terms. That is just a way to get into some more toxicity, Which is what we are trying to achieve by staying out of the wrong relationships in the first place."

1685,Wall St. Legend Gives Investors Another Warning...Will He Be Right Again?,Murray House,"This may be a dumb question but if you could answer it would be appreciated. If Matt the money market guy has his billion dollars from his bank sent to the fed in the reverse repo account for his 5 basis points that makes financial sense at the moment. The bank will receive a lets say billion dollar treasury when it sent the billion dollars to the reverse repo of the fed. My understanding is the reverse repo is the opposite of stimulation it actually is destroying cash. The bank is now buying a treasury from the fed for say a billion dollars to be bought back by the fed at an agreed time for an agreed price. Just the opposite of the repo market as the name suggests. My question is eventually that money will come back to matts account plus interest depending on the agreed time frame, so how does this permanently get rid of cash by its nature of being bought back this is only temporary reduction in a cash glut? How does this help in the long run? By the way great show, love the content."

1787,"Jeff Booth (Private Sector Vs Government Money Printing, Sound Money, Civil Unrest, Totalitarianism)",StockebroStudios,I think Jeffs thesis is wrong. I think technological &quot;deflation&quot; i.e. increasing productivity is essential to keep the current inflationary system alive. Too much inflation would increase the divide between the wealthy and poor even more and society would collapse. The only reason this is not happening is because people still can afford stuff because och technological deflation. Increased productivity offsets the debasement of currency.
1788,"Jeff Booth (Private Sector Vs Government Money Printing, Sound Money, Civil Unrest, Totalitarianism)",Nicholas Scholten,I listened to most of Jeff&#39;s book and it is okay.  I am glad I didn&#39;t have to pay for it.  Had to stop listening when he went on the endless diatribe about global warming caused by high concentrations of co2.  Lies.  Co2 is at lower bound and is not a pollutant.  Jeff is a globalists shill.<br>Listened to a 1970s NASA video about how they would be able to increase food production by increasing co2.  So now they want to decrease co2.  Get it....

The PBOC looks like it&#39;s stepping in but I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re not saving everyone.

2248,Real Estate Live Q&A,Hewit Rachael,"&lt;&lt;The crypto market has been unstable. People ask themselves now which coin to hodl better or if this is the right time to invest? before jumping to a conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading. I&#39;m still a hodler but stillI, I&#39;m winning by applying the same method in every trade, you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears), which is trading.

2264,Real Estate Live Q&A,Daz Bea,"George, thoughts on this please<br><br>You will own nothing, but you will be happy.<br>Beware of the low interest rate trap.<br><br>The World Economic Forum have not been shy about their utopian plan for owning everything. How would they achieve such a large scale property accumulation?<br><br>By creating a massive debt bubble and manipulating a decades-long low interest rate policy.<br><br>With lower and lower interest rates, the costs of capital become lower and lower, forcing asset prices higher and serviceability lower. This lures the mis-informed into a false sense of security and debt service affordability.<br><br>By keeping interest rates low, the everyday person, desperate to try and accrue assets is forced into these ever appreciating asset bubbles as it appears to be forever out of reach. They over leverage themselves on this false sense of affordability in the fear of the asset price appreciation moving even further out of their reach.<br><br>With a long term asset accumulation plan, if the global elite keep interest rates artificially low, more and more people pile into over levered positions. The slightest spike in interest rates will see this massive credit bubble pop.<br><br>Using a global pandemic and a global lockdown policy response alongside fiscal stimulus to spike competition for increased wages. We are limiting supply chains, increasing money supply and driving the concentration of purchasing toward  fewer outlets which leads to increased prices. The threat of increased corporate taxes leads to increased prices passed onto consumers, which leads to inflation. Increased stimulus leads to competition for work, which leads to increased wages, which leads to increased prices which leads to increased inflation.<br><br>What if this engineered inflation is leading to an ultimate end game that few people are talking about? What if the global elite’s end game is to cause massive interest rate hikesto pop this bubble and absorb the assets?<br><br>The global elite own the central banks and reserves. They will step in as the “heroes” to save the day by buying all the failing mortgage-backed securities and collateralised-loan-obligations with their printed fiat, thus accumulating all of the underlying assets in mass scale.<br><br>My assumption will be to let inflation run hot for a while, constantly devaluing the dollar, keeping interest rates low enough to force more force more people to over leverage on the assumption that they will never be able to raise rates and then, when the time is right, allow for interest rates to rise and start scooping up all the assets from property to equities to debt obligations and everything in between.<br>“Don’t worry, we will take that debt off your hands, wipe the bad debt from your record and let you rent it back from us”.<br><br>Be aware of the credit trap. Make sure your servicibility of debt can handle significant interest rate spikes and protect your investments."
2265,Real Estate Live Q&A,Dr.Stacker,how can this be true though when lenders mortgage affordability stress tests are getting harder and harder to pass. They are giving credit less freely nowadays and lending to mostly people who they have greater confidence in their ability to meet payments... even at increased rate. I.e. In the UK you WILL get stress tested at SVR + 3% which is anywhere between to 6-12% interest rate even though your fix may be at 1-3%.

2268,Real Estate Live Q&A,Justin Reese,Listening to George talk about Friedman I completely agree. The thing I keep thinking about is we live in a global economy.

In a controlled communist economy you won’t see this. They will just lie and prop their system up. So how do you compete against a corrupt system? You have to do the same right?

2443,Dominic Frisby (History Of Taxation Provides Insights To The Future Of Taxation And Freedom),TJ Koch,NO TAXES!!! I would like to introduce you guys to crowdfunding. We can have a society with zero taxes that is completely based on voluntary interaction using crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is a superior way for a society to allocate its resources compared to taxes.
2444,Dominic Frisby (History Of Taxation Provides Insights To The Future Of Taxation And Freedom),Michael,"Great discussion! The Swiss tax system is one of the better ones in the world. Three tiers - First tier  is Federal tax, second tier  Cantonal (so local benefit), and third tier is a local communal tax (the road outside your home.....).  And the cantons and communes compete to attract taxpayers by setting the lowest taxes. And they do that by cutting the costs of government services through efficiency and productivity,  This is a very productive society and taxes are generally low."

I hope I can get my question answered with the call. I put it out there now. I have a 2nd house it is paid for. Sell? get the fiat money for it, it may become worthless. rent - I am tired of this business. I have the house since 1999. I do not trust the bank to cash out a big check, because of the new law, that if they have to they can just take the money. What do I do with the cash. I have no debt. I am not a gambler, but I would like to do the best for myself. Taxes will go way up because of the unrealized gain and bogus valuation. I hope you can give me an answer to my dilemma.

2576,Is Inflation Here To Stay? (Answer Will Shock You!),clive mossmoon,"Persistently declining interest rates puts DOWNWARD pressure on prices as producers are seduced into refinancing more supply at lower costs (of funds). Government regulations and compliance measures and taxes put UPWARD pressure on prices. &quot;Money printing&quot; will not be the reason we blow off into hyperinflation, it will be the bankruptcies of the marginal producers as their profits are squeezed to nothing at the same time consumers/savers and producers begin building inventories due to uncertainty about the future. Idiotic government actions will only speed up the process.  If you want to learn more, have Keith Weiner on your show. He&#39;s been right for years as Austrians like Schiff have been wrong and wronger. It&#39;s not time yet. The 10 yr, even the 30 yr need to hit zero and we need to see gold go bid/no offer (permanent backwardation)."

That assumes the gov. doesn&#39;t just keep increasing those &#39;&#39;benefits&#39;&#39;, and most of these small businesses requiring unskilled labor haven&#39;t already been wiped out by the time such a mechanism has had time to work itself out through wage inflation.

Nothing goes up or falls in a straight line. But the Reichsmark did NOT appreciate in value against gold (or the dollar, which is pretty much the same, as the dollar was tied to gold) over the time span from 1920 - 1922. Please stop spreading this nonsense.<br>Everyone can look up the exchange rate between Mark and dollar for this period:<br>1920 : Mark flutuates between ~38 mark/dollar and ~73 mark/dollar;<br>1921: Mark fluctuates between ~ 57 and 236 mark/dollar<br>1922: Mark started the year at ~187 mark/dollar and ended the year at 7350 mark/dollar (marking a low in that year at ~8500mark/dollar) - it was summer 1922, when hyperinflation kicked in.<br>So the Reichsmark had become very volatile, but actually it was clear, that the mark was in the way to its end after the first world war as it had been pretty much stable (and tied to gold) before the war at 4.20/dollar."

2711,"Robert Barnes (Fed Suit Update, Legality Of Vax Passports? Wealth Tax, CDC Power Grab)",Runner RN,Also many colleges and universities have already said all returning on campus students are required to take the Cvid jab. It’s mandatory.  Who is then liable for adverse effects post-jab?  Are the schools then liable?  They will likely also have to alter HIPPA laws because it’s currently illegal to access medical records without consent.
2712,"Robert Barnes (Fed Suit Update, Legality Of Vax Passports? Wealth Tax, CDC Power Grab)",Runner RN,He’s wrong on medical mandates on access to schooling because several states removed all but medical exemptions to shamxxines and children were forced to get them or kicked out of school. Children’s Health Defense has been on this issue for years and have not been able to allow religious exemptions. State level no religious exemptions allowed. They don’t even allow groups more than 5 to home school and private schools are also subject to these state rules.

2750,"Robert Barnes (Fed Suit Update, Legality Of Vax Passports? Wealth Tax, CDC Power Grab)",Eric Fisher,"The vaccine passports are the introduction of a global QR code.  This is an app on your phone initially for the purpose of identifying that you have had the vaccine.  Truth be told, it is ultimately an app to tie in your medical history, your finances, your ability to spend through a digital currency,tracking, and your citizen rating,  perhaps more.  It will give the powers that be the opportunity to shut you off at a moments notice.  It will impede you ability to travel, go shopping, and do the things we consider normal, unless you comply with what the powers that be want you to do.  People need to seriously wake up and realize where things are going, it is not a conspiracy theory by any means.  If the World Economic Forum can make a statement as this, &quot;You will own nothing, and you will be happy&quot;, we are in deep dodo for our futures.  I also encourage people to investigate Bill Gates and his push for power in the WHO, his investments in companies that create vaccine passports, human tattooing, synthetic meat, the globalization of GMO seeds, vaccine patents, the largest private holder of farm land in the US, and on and on.  He is one of the oligarchs that wants global power and control, there are many, including the IMF, WHO, CDC, UN, and all the central banks.  Look up Fed Coin, the projected digital currency from the Fed that will bypass and destroy commercial banks throughout our country, it is about centralized control of all the currency in the world through a small group of individuals, who again, would have the ability to shut you down in an instant if you were considered non compliant to their agenda.  Wake up people it is happening faster than you know, especially with the Modern Monetary Theory concept, as they will print the dollars value into oblivion."

2783,Is Copper The Next Bitcoin? Experts Say YES!! (Here's Why),Monkfish39,Copper is not the only highly conductive material that can be used. If copper’s  price tripled then manufacturers would start looking for replacement materials some of which would have better properties. The use of which becomes economical at a triple copper price point.<br>Graphene provides many use cases that could replace copper but it is currently too expensive. <br>Copper price rise will be dampened by graphene adoption. It is also not just graphene that is being researched. Current research into synthetic diamond production holds massive innovative potential. <br>Whenever something becomes more expensive innovation comes in left side! <br>Horse feed vs oil for example. Innovation  in drilling for oil as opposed to getting whale oil massively changed our transportation industry overnight. Some may have said horse feed was set to double with the population rise in city’s at the time.

Covered calls are great, but only AFTER you have done the tax work and found it profitable.  For most people, the absolute best way to use options will be to go LONG stocks that they plan on holding forever, and buying PUTS as insurance on those stocks."

I wanted to add to the discussion on supercomputers running the economy. Even if all the equations are solvable, in addition to the issues of entrepreneurship that Bob mentioned, the inputs to the equations are human preferences, which are unknowable. My kid brings home an A on their report card, and we go out to celebrate. How does the computer know that? How does it know what flavor ice cream I&#39;m going to want? Or tonight, instead of a cheap beef stew, I just feel like taking the family to an expensive steak house. How could that be accounted for? The math says that beef stew is cheaper and supplies all necessary nutrients, so it&#39;s beef stew, every night, forever?  Or do we get one steakhouse night per month?  And we have to wait for the computer to tell us when we are allowed to go out for steak? What kind of horrific &quot;utopia&quot; is this?"

2902,"Bob Murphy (Freedom Principles, MMT, Free Banking, Inflation Prediction, Future Social Unrest)",Sue Diem,"Born in USSR, I know and can tell you that:<br><br>Von Mises was absolutely right about the USSR and their soviet economic calculation problem (SECP). Just because most people would have no idea what is this all about and therefore do not involve such memories in their recall of the USSR collapse, does not mean Mises was wrong.<br><br>There is a lot of misinformation on the internet and in the media, designed to place the fault for the failure of the USSR on whatever else but remove it from the core issue that Mises had identified. All these stories about Reagan, Star Wars, Gulag, Antibiotics, Environment, Afghanistan - this is all just wet socialist dreams, they have been brought forward as possible collapse causes precisely because they will be dealt with in the next incarnation of the socialism. The Mises SECP is something that will never be solved and therefore makes the socialism impossible, forever.<br><br>This is similar to how most money &quot;gurus&quot; will tell you all the benefits / requirements of true money, lol, invariably skipping the only one, funny enough, I would say sort of important one : &quot;cannot be created by the government&quot;. They are just propagandists for the government. Buy bitcorn!<br><br>When USSR collapsed:<br><br>We absolutely despised all domestic goods, &quot;domestic&quot; was an offensive word. Because domestic goods were invariably NOT WHAT WE WANTED. They were either ugly, or cheap, or expensive, or too durable or not durable nearly long enough, or dumb or too complicated or just at the wrong time at the wrong place. I was a teenager, and if you&#39;d gift me a 1000 worth of domestic goods, I would rather take a 1 worth of &quot;made in USA&quot;. It went so far, that had you give me that publicly, in front of my friends, - I would be defaced, I would hate you and wish you&#39;d never pop in my way.<br><br>But the adults were TOO BUSY with life and praises to Brezhnev to pay attention to this important indicator. To may-be, stop and think &quot;Why is this?&quot; So, in late 80-ies this situation led to an absolute rejection of all domestic production (I heard a 70% figure), in favor of the most expensive imports (USA, UK, EUROPE, very little of the underdeveloped world), and also in the way of the least efficient trade type (smuggling) - since officially we would never want to do this.<br>Everything domestic was for sell at any price in favor of everything imported, everyone was shopping at the &quot;black bazaars&quot;. My mother spent six month to save money to buy me (16 yo BD) &quot;made in the USA&quot; jeans that lasted for years, while the domestic ones were so ugly, even a down syndrome kid would reject them after one day. Everyone began openly rejecting everything domestic. Money were sipping through every hole of the old USSR and then that was converted to something else to buy the goods that people wanted. Yes, much was stolen, but this was the main process.<br><br>This is what gave a soviet juggernaut a death uppercut. And after that, the system had lost it&#39;s stability and it was just a matter of random sequence of events that finished it officially. They more they tried to lower the rates.... errrr, I meant the more they tried to fix the dead man walking system, the more obvious were the disconnected body parts on the floor.<br><br>Bill also suggested that there is a good reason that the computers would not be able to solve the SECP.<br>He made a nice explanation, but maybe he had missed something closer to the core:<br><br>Te reason why no amount of central planners would not be able to decide what to produce (for short), and neither a bunch of super computers will ever be able to, is because we, the people, cannot clearly define what we want, how, when and how bad. When we have prices, we can figure that out by having to make the choice. A choice we can do. So, the computers, even if they could collect some data to get closer to our imprecisely defined emotionally driven wants, any system that would enforce the choice and the consequence of choice, would then function the same as prices, and will in essence be no different than the free market.<br><br>And if it isn&#39;t a free market, then either it will be impossible to compute, or it will be impossible to define, or it will be without consequences. Any of these three missing will again produce a defective system fated to failure.<br><br><br><br>We also were absolutely destroyed morally. Everyone hated everyone else, and that is true even today. I mean today in Russia. US is only starting to taste the enforcement of love.<br>This is because the law was prescribing us to love each other, just like some of these new laws today in America. But such laws always create an absolutely opposite effect (did Murray Rothbard say that?) - they were making us to hate each other.<br><br>Bill said something about us getting scared by the Gulags? He could be easily forgiven for he didn&#39;t live there. Gulags were in our memory. Tens of millions went thru them. Rare family wouldn&#39;t have at least one member in the Gulags. No, that wasn&#39;t the issue. It&#39;s not that they were OK, it&#39;s just that killing tens of millions of citizens per generation is just a normal feature of any socialist country. You gotta kill your neighbor. You will understand why, too.<br><br>The people who made the USSR, the &quot;comrades&quot; were some sort of insane beasts. It is clear that they were bloody revolutionaries, but I do not understand their reasoning, because they have created a world a thousand times worse than what they destroyed. Again, modern parallels come to mind, because the idiot revolutionaries of today live in easily one of the best countries in the world (yes, it is mildly arguable), and yet, they want to destroy this all and they have absolutely no idea of what the want to build.<br><br>I mean a real workable practical plan that would actually be better, not just  mouth breather&#39;s wet dream that they talk about non stop.<br><br>But when the USSR was ready to collapse, that generation was long gone, and we were all just the prisoners of horrid reality. None of us chose or wanted to be born there. Yet we were born and brainwashed, and plugged in their socialist matrix and we were expected to continue to work for the ideas that made me, personally, puke, and then expected to become a cannon powder in some s-hole country, &quot;liberating&quot; them from a normal, happy life.<br><br>Equality? Of opportunity, yes, that&#39;s cool, I&#39;ll take that every day but that was not available to us. The minorities, the odd weird peoples from all corners of the globe, still with their ear piercings and war drums attached were given the priority always and everywhere. Somehow, they needed to have everything first, because someone else did them wrong and they failed to defend themselves. But if you were just a stupid white Russian? You were the last person in any line. It is still much the same there today, but you won&#39;t be shown that on RT (you do know the RT is just a &quot;Kremlin Channel&quot; right?)<br><br>Equality of results? I&#39;d rather die than to live in that world. Whats the point? You spend some time studying while the other guys spends it partying, then you both given the test just hard enough so that he can pass, and he gets the job?

Inflationary expectations are too low IMO.  But the end game of USD to CBDC makes a lot of sense.  I think we don’t necessarily need to have the DXY hitting those 110 levels if CPI is high when USD starts to reverse.  It’s relative.  If commodities/assets/USD off lows all move upward while assets and CPI are already elevated (and propped up fiscally)  it creates those additional supply shortages compounded due to dollar denominated debt.  That creates conflict internationally and lights the match.

Anyone can look up Euromono and note that the all mortality rate for Europe is not significantly different from previous flu seasons. Those who would have died from seasonal flu have died from covid-19, which has evidently suppressed previous flu strains. Not saying that covid-19 is something to be dismissed but all the charts and data are showing that covid-19 is not even close to a Spanish flu scenario but is more like Hong Kong flu, which at the time the world just shrugged its shoulders and went to Woodstock. And no the lockdowns and masks have not saved the world as any reasonable assessment of the available charts and data shows  Do understand also that WHO pandemic guidelines prior to Covid did not recommend public wearing if masks and societal shutdowns.

Whites are taught/conditioned to NOT be tribal in the West by policy and to &quot;look after&quot; others (white savior syndrome)-look no further than Affirmative Action policies that work against whites and even the welfare state, which &quot;people of color&quot; have access to even though it&#39;s mostly funded by tax dollars paid for by a white majority. There aren&#39;t enough &quot;people of color&quot; being true net tax payers paying into the state to fund it at the rates that others of their &quot;tribe&quot; deplete it. Whites are SYSTEMATICALLY TAUGHT to hate themselves and put others&#39; needs above their own, including their own family. It&#39;s seen as laudable to donate money to a philanthropic cause and not leave it to your own children, which is ridiculous in any other country or culture on Earth. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq06ZhFxQpI&amp;t=1h48m00s"">1:48:00</a>, Rollo AGREES with me! He states that men have been conditioned to put others&#39; needs first. That includes needs of other ethnic groups that DO remain tribal in their preferences and definitely favor their own people ahead of anyone else.

Not just looks, clothes, cars, houses, financial status &amp; potential, and so on w/r to superficial aspects... One of the biggest turn on&#39;s for me is INTELLECT and SHARING THAT WITH OTHERS TO BENEFIT OTHERS. Did he even name that one? A man that you can have meaningful discussions with, laugh with, feel important to, know that he values people just because they&#39;re people, etc. - where are THOSE aspects in his analyses???

3126,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Danny,"Having more goods and services is nice but really your health is your wealth.<br><br>If we all agree that money really needs to be created by simply printing it into existence or by entering numbers onto a balance sheet or into a computer and calling it currency, I am not sure if I agree and remember I am saying “if we all agree&quot;,  then I think the government (a fairly elected and democratic one) should be the only authority allowed to create this currency for the nation.  Furthermore, if the government decides to spend more than it can collect in taxes, then again, I think the government should be the only authority allowed to create the extra currency without borrowing any from the private banks since they just simply create it the same way the government does resulting in the government having to pay interest on the currency that the private banks created. At least if the government creates the money they do not have a debt that needs to be paid back and they do not have to pay interest on a debt. It has often be said that the government should not be in the banking business but in reality the banks should not be in the governments business. Controlling the nation’s money/currency is one of the most import jobs the government has right up there with national defence and protecting us from criminals and protecting our privacy. Private commercial banks should only be allowed to lend money/currency that they actually have not create money/currency by giving out fake loans by simply entering the loan amount into an account or computer. <br><br>FIAT currency has value because you and I believe in the government and are willing to work for the currency it issues. When our faith in the government goes, so will the power of the currency. If we do not have faith in the government, we will not have a nation nor a  civil economy. Without government, there will be some type of anarchy based economy. Some may think this is a good thing, I am not one of them. A government can always be thrown out of power and a new one voted in."

3149,Dave Collum (Profit From Central Planning And “Money Printing!”)?,kolton crane,He’s right about the environmental<br>Hoax. California is letting their water run to the ocean basically to flush out their sewer. They have tons of sewage leaks so they just let rivers flow to flush out the waste and then say they’re saving an endangered fish. <br><br>Another thing to look into is the eucalyptus tree in California that’s non native from Australia I think. Australian fires were terrible but they let this tree grow everywhere. California has a similar issue. The eucalyptus tree is highly flammable with tons of oils that burn so it’s just asking for a fire. The tree grows back quicker after a fire so they actually spread more and more with more fires. I never heard about this on the news until I watched some Australian YouTube channels that actually pointed out this issue.

We must understand that the main head of this evil hydra is the financial monetary system which centralises the control of money in the hands of a corrupt few. That’s why it is incumbent on all who love freedom to familiarise themselves with alternatives to this system and fortunately we also live in an unprecedented time of opportunity where we can now bypass this system with anonymous, private and decentralised cryptocurrencies such as Monero and especially Pirate Chain. Please familiarise yourself with these alternatives, particularly Pirate Chain, as it will likely take off to the moon in the next coming months as well as provide protection against the coming inflation from the Fed and more importantly, provide an alternative to the financial tyranny that’s coming our way"

Unfortunately after the Temperance movement of the Women&#39;s (WCTU) caused cultural shifts, not unlike today. I appreciate the way you look at it."

Let’s not argue one extreme with another. That’s the problem with the world today. <br><br>He says nobody wants electric cars except because governments regulations hindering gas cars ... that’s a bold statement speaking for everybody’s opinion. I personally want one, Tesla for example is production limited with a waiting list, and there’s a growing community of ppl who love there electric cars and will never go back. <br><br>All the electricity comes from dirty coal plants.... that’s also changing slowly to renewable energy. In some states and countries they are already having 30-40% of energy generated from wind and solar. No extremes -we will still need fossil fuels, but a lot of energy will be produced from renewable in the future. Eric’s argument on coal plant is shrinking he better come up with new material. <br><br>Lastly how is he gonna make an argument on how dangerous lithium ion batteries are, but also talk about how great hybrids could be.....<br><br>Please George. No extremes let’s be reasonable. There’s a spectrum of each specific point that is changing over time. The guy on horse and buggy laughed at the gas car because his horse could go anywhere on grass and water, but here we are with gas stations on every corner.

At the beginning of the pandemic, I bought a lot of masks, just in case we needed them. Turns out we did, but Ebay was keeping people from price gouging by only allowing certain people to sell masks (and at a high price, too! $500/pack I saw) resulting in people having rooms and rooms of masks that they just couldn’t distribute. Etsy had the exact opposite approach and encouraged the sale. I sold my masks for less than wal mart was selling them for pre pandemic, and they flew off the shelf. I never bought more because I felt I did my case (supplying the west coast with masks seemingly overnight) and so I exited the market long before it was exhausted but I got a huge…like basically 3 months worth of pay in a few weeks, and then I sell stuff online so sales are up! I’ve had to ditch Ebay because…I just never knew they are actually criminals or….completely inept. I had to stop for ethical reasons. If there is speak of any attack on America, I definitely view Ebay in that light.

The middle and upper middle class see their expenses stay the same or increase due to having to pay for a substitute childcare/education service because public schools stopped providing their services in 2020.

3419,"Lyn Alden (Economic Outcomes Now Tied To Politics, Inflation/Deflation, Global Opportunities)",Christopher Morrison,"Lyn’s problem is she doesn’t differentiate between debt financed government spending and QE’s quasi-money printing. They are different and that is a cold hard fact. The government stimulus money comes from debt and the government is just about the most inefficient spender of cash on the planet. Government multipliers are mostly negative!!! So if the government borrows $1(removes it from the economy) and then sends stimulus checks back in by spending $.30, that isn’t very productive. There is absolutely not a 1 to 1 ratio. Everything the government spends was removed from the economy somewhere prior. It has nothing to do with bank reserves, those are not the money. It drives me insane hearing this crap all of the time. You don’t get sustained inflation when you are at 130% of debt to gdp with a bad economy. We will never have another fiscal package like Roosevelt’s highway program. We already have the highways!! You want sustained inflation, cut gov spending in half, remove all tax loopholes and use the extra revenue to pay down the debt, and then cut as much red tape around businesses as imaginable."

Yes, Americans do not understand the world, they cannot comprehend how other countries are not Americans. And they also bring their internal ever-crazier politics abroad. As the result there are failures, but there were good examples too! How about asking someone in Southern Korea, or Taiwan, or Israel about the US support? From how much of a disaster the US saved them? What would happen in Vietnam, if the US did not withdraw there? Would there be a Southern Vietnam, as advanced and successful as Korea?<br><br>And Europe too. If the US did not land in Europe on Day D, Soviet Union would occupy Germany and France. If the US were not in Italy, SU would occupy Italy too. Europe would consists of fascists on Iberian peninsula and communists behind the iron curtain everywhere else.<br><br>At the same time, of course the reason why Europeans lean so much to communism is precisely because the US saved them from it! If Europe did what it wanted all along 20th century and submerged into socialism-communism-serfdom, this disaster would have already finished some decades ago. Although, I doubt communism would historically die out without a sort of Nuremberg process, like social-nationalism. But Europe would at least meet with the reality before China became so overwhelming and Islam woke up again. Nowadays, it seems only the UK has a good position for future normality.

3496,"Bill Fleckenstein (Fed Deep Dive, Debt Jubilee, Inflation, Bonds, Pro Investing Secrets Revealed)",m&m,"On the inflation front, I tend to think that the inflation pressures must ultimately win (mainly because government debt must be paid, and the only way for this to happen to create negative real yields for an extended period of time).  <br><br>However, as Devils advocate, I&#39;d like your thoughts on the following hypothesis that supports an alternative view.  I&#39;ve never heard it articulated, but it seems to make sense to me at least.  Basically, the argument is that the money supply with fractional reserve banking currency is debt based and currency is created when people take a loan and destroyed when people pay back loans.   But people don&#39;t take out loans indefinitely.  Regardless of banks willingness to lend, most people decide for themselves when they have taken too much debt because they know they will eventually need to pay it back.  (There are exceptions to this rule but these people usually go broke at an early age).   At some point where people don&#39;t want more debt it just doesn&#39;t matter how many reserves are in the banking system because reserves are not the problem.  Thus QE doesn&#39;t do anything. If there is too much debt already people don&#39;t want more, thus loans will not occur, thus money multipliers will not exist, and more currency will not be created in the real economy.  Further, as people save and pay back the loans it actually contracts the money supply.  So to entice more loans, the rates drop, until loans are essentially free (current state) but even with free money most people still feel uneasy taking on more debt beyond what they know they can reasonably pay back with a job.  After rates are near the zero bound, new loans get harder and harder to find, and the money supply simply maxes out.  This acts as a rev limiter on money supply itself and prevents further inflation.<br><br>Even stimmy checks don&#39;t really change this because they people don&#39;t expect them to go on for long enough to incur more debt and take out a loan.  Instead, just a fear of bad times ahead tend to make people save up a little in preparation, and the money supply remains stable at a limit of peoples perception of how much debt they can take on.  So, this implies an end game where there is not hyperinflation or deflation, but instead just an extended period of slow economic growth and near zero interest rates."

So the janitors that night smoked a spliff and decided to screw around playing like they are running a game show. So the new &#39;contestant&#39; has to guess which door has  a big prize. No door number 3 is involved. The  janitor contestant  picks door number one. . Now are his odds 1 in 3 like the contestant that was called away when he picked door number 1, or were the odds reset to 50 / 50 for door number 1 choice? Are the odds tied to the first contestant, to the set, to Monty Hall,  to the time line or something else?

3592,Banks Face Mysterious SLR Crisis!! (Hidden Dangers Revealed),ToIsleOfView,"Taxes? Really? Corporations NEVER take a loss for taxes. They raise the price of their goods and services to keep profits exactly the same. If they are selling to foreign markets this will reduce their competitive advantage. No problem... just move the corporation or the profits to a foreign country with lower taxes. Commodity selling corporations like FARMERS are the ones that take it on the chin. Foreign production will be lower cost and sell out while domestic production rots in storage and American Farmers get foreclosed on. It&#39;s a vicious circle of destruction when taxes are put on corporations. It&#39;s the DOLLAR crash that is putting the US Treasury in real trouble.  Banks that are tied to the Treasury are in danger of collapse when dollars lose value. The Federal Reserve banks are not subject to the US Treasury except to declare their note as legal tender. The families &amp; shareholders of the reserve banks buy REAL ASSETS like real estate, gold, &amp; silver. What they have learned is that paying for real assets with worth-less dollars gets rid of their fake fortune and puts real fortune into their control. Elites owning American farmland will force farmers to rent the land they used to own."

They are not long term thinkers. They are short term thinkers. The system is essentially one that is designed to fail. If they raise your taxes, it is because they see it as enhancing their personal wealth, either directly or indirectly. They have no concern for how raising taxes and regulations impacts overall job growth or general welfare. Their concern is for how they might be personally enriched as a result of doing so. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t make mistakes in their assessment of what will personally enrich them.

3773,LIVE STREAM Q&A,goldassayer93555,"The Larger Trend<br> <br><br>Since world war 2 the United States Government and the Federal Reserve bank have been debasing the US Currency and lying about the resulting inflation in prices. As a result the American workers have been earning less purchasing power so that where a single income family could live comfortably in the 1950’s and 1960’s it began to take 2 incomes in the 1980’s and then borrowed money in the 1990’s<br>Now in the 2220’s two incomes plus borrowed money are not enough, the Home Equity line of credit has drained the equity from the family home. The young graduates have no job prospects and $100,000 in debt so have no chance of starting a career or family. Unmarried’s cannot afford to rent a room so the population of homeless and street dwellers is growing.<br><br>Add to this that the next three 11 year Solar Cycles are expected to have lower solar energy output, the weaker solar magnetic field is allowing an increase in cosmic ray’s in the atmosphere so we have more cloud cover cooling the planet and these factors are making the price of food rise.<br>Increased cosmic rays also are suspected to cause heating of the planet’s magma. You may have noticed in the last couple years a steady increase in the number of volcanoes simultaneously erupting. There are currently 52 volcanoes erupting and signs that Iceland will soon have an active eruption.<br>Erupting volcanoes fill the atmosphere with dust, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide all of which block solar energy.<br>Given these difficulties, the solution will be to get land by whatever means you can (legally) and start growing fruit trees, grains, vegetables and fish, chicken etc.<br>This will not give you an easy income at first due to low prices but later when food gets scarce it will.<br>There will not be work in farming for most people as at the present the price of food is too low and farmers and ranchers are having to compete with the lowest cost food producers in the world as foreign laborers are working for minimal wages and shipping is extremely cheap.<br><br>These conditions will change as soon as we have any disaster or war that changes international access to foreign sources of food or food growers suffer losses due to the above conditions.<br><br>Be smart, learn to farm or ranch now and get the experience necessary to grow a small homestead. Start now as it takes 5 years to get trees to produce decently. You won’t compete with a large farm because of the costs of startup versus the price competition. Get a small homestead with low taxes and minimal government rules and regulation.<br>When food gets expensive you will have little trouble growing what you need.<br><br>Good luck"

3792,Michael Burry Warns Of HYPERINFLATION! (I Explain Why),Darren McCammon,"Burry is still too early.  People do what they think is in their own best interests, and Powell is more politically conscious than most previous Fed chairs.  Thus he will find a reason not to significantly reduce QE or raise rates until after he is reappointed.  Whether the motivation is conscious or subconscious, he knows normalizing rates before then would cost him his re-appointment.   A month or two after he is re-appointed by the Biden Administration and confirmed, e.g. April &#39;22 is my bet for when rates will be allowed to rise significantly."

3862,Jason Hartman (How YOU Can Make Money With A 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage - Deep Dive),Lawrence Kdog,"Great interview--thanks to both of you. I agree with your math on the whole &quot;paying back loans with inflated dollars&quot;--yes this makes sense. But, running the numbers it still does not make sense to buy a house now when the market is at it&#39;s peak, and also if there is a crash. You are better off waiting for the crash, if its say 50% as many in the field have guessed it will be, then you are def better off buying at 50% with a higher interest rate than you are buying now with a low interest rate. Running the numbers on a 50% crash, interest rates would have to go way higher than history shows they will go in order for the payment to be the same when the purchase price is 1/2 what it is now. Also, other things to consider, what will my pay be, it seems you assume it will rise in the future, and if my own personal history has anything to say, it will most likely not for the average person. <br>Another thing I am not getting, and maybe it&#39;s just me, is what about all the interest you are paying on that loan? You say its better not to pay off your mortgage early, please explain why I should not try to pay it off early and save a couple hundred thousand dollars on interest?? Am I missing something here? Yes I get you say I should pay it back with inflated dollars, but if I chose to pay it off in 15 years, saving hundreds of thousands on interest, can I  not then invest those hundreds of thousands for a greater return than I will get arbitraging inflated dollars to pay of the original loan?

3868,Jason Hartman (How YOU Can Make Money With A 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage - Deep Dive),David Rhee,"Though the point being made is reasonable and true (if everything else is constant), the reality is that it is not the case...<br>Yes, you are correct that the value of US Dollar will depreciate over time (less buying power) but you are assuming that the person will have a steady income in the next 30 years to pay off the mortgage (let alone, the property tax, insurance, maintenance, dues, interest on the loan. etc.) Again, if you are paying for the loan which is not often offset by the credit on your taxes, you are still paying (depreciated or not in value)... Again, if you consider the wage increases (if that is your only source of income) does not match or exceed the inflation rate, that is compounding against what you paying off the mortgage amount period. We have not consider other worse case scenarios.. I would look at 30 year fixed and pay minimum if I have revenue stream beyond income and ensuring that I am able to withstand a rainy day. As we saw with COVID19, many people who did follow this approach got hammered.. Luckily, the housing market was strong but if not, you will end up losing more than you gained."

The 5 year rate is about 2% right now, and the 25 yr rate is about 9%.

3891,Jason Hartman (How YOU Can Make Money With A 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage - Deep Dive),Kerrie,Pay attention to the 10 year yield. It&#39;s been moving up indicating inflation. It doesn&#39;t have to move very much to become a big problem. Ten years ago the 10 year yield headed down creating a deflationary situation. With the yields moving up in the last month things could be changing.
3892,Jason Hartman (How YOU Can Make Money With A 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage - Deep Dive),Robert Kooiman,Great podcast! <br>I have a question about interest rates. Governments will have to use YCC to keep rates low to cover their debt  but will they also keep repo rates low so that mortgage rates stay low also? I listen to mr Rapier on Marco Voices and he said one way to keep inflation in check is to make access to credit harder.

3934,Why $15 Minimum Wage Is GOOD! (Shocking Intel Revealed),Austin Byrd,"Get another job if you don&#39;t wanna work that amount. There&#39;s competition competing for your labor. <br>Demanding higher wages (if they actually pay it and don&#39;t go through <i>glaring loopholes</i> in the law) will lead to <b>negative pressure</b> on employment, prices, productivity, working conditions, and/or benefits to make up the higher cost of labor. All of which disproportionately hurt those of lower skill/capability. <br><br>Employers get around most of the cost imposed through cutting paid hours, then practically requiring &#39;volunteer&#39; unpaid hours. They get paid the same amount, work the same amount, but at different time intervals. Time is money. If I have to pay you more over a shorter period of time, then there&#39;s more risk in that investment of capital. Labor is then more risky and thereby disincentivized, even where the market otherwise demands it. This is only a slight detriment, but a net negative nonetheless. That combined with mutual law breakers and businesses pricing the effects of the minimum ahead of time (before their implementation) heavily negates the damage seen through statistics. <br>The minimum doesn&#39;t help anyone. Like all price controls, it either leads to people getting around the law, reduction in quantity (to downright shortages), worse quality products/services, and/or higher prices."

3948,Why $15 Minimum Wage Is GOOD!

A beer was £10 and a pizza was £25. Best pizza ever though.<br> I prefer minimum wage to state benefits supported low salaries that are are basically a tax funded subsidy to businesses. In the uk we have age banded minimum wages. My school age daughter is on £5/hr and considers herself as rich as Croesus!  Make it £15 and her waitress job will evaporate quicker than summer snow.<br> Be careful what you wish for cos you just might get it! There ain’t no free lunch. Even in Denmark!

If it stays low then it&#39;s going to continue to be expensive to finance until enough houses come on the market and foreclosures hit the market. It&#39;s looking like Jun-Dec will have more supply, higher rates Sooo hopefully prices will begin to drop. <br><br><b>*Also in the stimulus bill they seem to be allowing certain types of loans go into foreclosure at certain times... they&#39;re hoping to soften the blow to the housing market.

Product availability is being limited to main colors and SKU&#39;s with some manufacturers cutting off some of their options and lines altogether.

4131,Janet Yellen Triggered An Economic Time Bomb!! (You Won’t Believe This),Dave B,"George...I don&#39;t think you got this one right. Your analysis is correct that there will be a giant shift in funds from the TGA to the commercial banks on the next round of stimulus.  A bigger problem than where the banks can deploy these funds, however, is that the commercial banks won&#39;t have sufficient  capital (equity) under adequacy rules to support the influx of funds. Their choices will be i) raise additional capital, or ii) lock the  new influx of funds out of the bank. They aren&#39;t going to raise capital in the equity market to support excess reserves at the Fed, damaging their EPS. They could charge fees to accept the new funds generating the capital through earnings, similar to negative interest rates where you pay the banks to take your money. Or does the banking system have insufficient capital capacity and the funds have to go into individual NOW accounts held directly at the Fed. Of course, these will be digital currency accounts. Is this how we&#39;ll be forced into banking at the Fed?"

It&#39;s being slowly chipped away by inflation, which is always underestimated by governments and corpos, to keep wage slaves under impression that they are getting somewhere. Same with the protection of environment. It&#39;s not the employees that protest bad environmental practices, but governments regulating and threatening business with fines forces them to clean after themselves.

4212,Great Reset Now Being Pushed By Corporate America!! (Shocking Intel Revealed),The Pickled Onions,"Well and good in a free market, but we&#39;re not living in the 1960&#39;s. You have a case in Ireland whereby our government&#39;s sole economic objective for the past 20 years plus has been to attract fdi from financial services sector, pharma and tech. A lot of the big boys were given zero tax deals under the table.<br>Case in point is Apple been taken to task by the European Courts (rightly imo) and been ordered to pay 13bn in back taxes to our revenue under anti competition laws. Our government is currently spending millions in taxpayers money to fight the decision on behalf of Apple.<br><br>What we&#39;re left with here is an economy that&#39;s built on the world&#39;s biggest money laundering factory on the Dublin docklands, tech companies like Google that pay good wages but zero taxes.<br>We have a housing policy that allows hedge funds to come in and purchase full housing estates and apartment blocks (buy to let) before they even get to market, causing a chronic lack of housing for ordinary people to buy and leading to hugely inflated rent and purchase costs. <br>Post crash we also sold off portfolios at firesale prices to vulture funds (with tax incentives) just to make the the temporary balance sheets look good.<br><br>The long and short of it is that we have the highest debt per capita in Europe. Middle income earners are shouldering massive tax burdens so multinationals don&#39;t have to. Effective tax rate of roughly 50% on anything earned over 33,000 euro.<br><br>I think what&#39;s going on at the WEF is despicable and nefarious beyond the comprehension of most people in this country, but runaway capitalism and light touch regulation has shit on it&#39;s own doorstep too.<br>So what&#39;s the answer?"

4277,"Martin North (Economic House Of Cards, Stimmy Infinity, Unintended Consequences Of Central Planners)",David King,"Great analysis from this interview. Thanks for that.<br>The reason the &quot;work from home&quot; idea worked was because much of the Australian workforce has transferred to now work for the Government. It is effectively a means to keep people off the streets and rioting as there is not much actual work in Australia. So the Government creates a lot of &quot;non-jobs&quot; in the public service to keep people busy which is paid for in large part by the taxes earned from the mining sector. One only has to look at the graphs of growth in public sector jobs vs growth in public sector jobs and you will see they are basically inverted.<br>Part of the reason the whole housing sector is working is that people who bought into the market 10+ years ago are selling out with the equity they have, moving to the country buying a house and land with that equity and working from home. The new home buyers are buying those houses in the city for extremely high prices as discussed on this video.<br>What I don&#39;t think we realise is that these ex-office jobs are the new frontier of the gig economy. Why pay someone in Australia a high wage to work from home when clearly you can do it remotely from anywhere in the world. I think these people will soon realise that their previous $100k+ jobs will be reduced to a -50k job because it can be outsourced overseas. So now they will go from being poor in the city to being poor in the country where there is very little in the way of support systems."

He emphasises the difficult choices facing the Fed, as they seek to achieve inflation while avoiding a $/bond market/economic collapse, He explains how he is grappling with the sequencing of events as we approach the Napier “end game/reset”. And he expects in the first instance the avoidance of tough choices, muddling through, repeating what’s been tried before etc. I am getting increasingly sceptical of the simple linear narratives being pushed by certain macro commentators. The global financial and monetary system has become so complex, interdependent, leveraged and detached from the real economy (fundamentals) that’s it has become impossible to forecast.

4369,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Danny,"We need to get away from the thinking that money can be created by pretending to lend somebody money and then expecting to be paid back with real money and to add insult to injury paid back with interest!<br><br>Why should an organization like a bank that does not produce anything or have any money to lend be in a position to simply enter digits into an account or into a computer and call it money by putting another organization who actually produces something into debt and the organization that produces something then has to pay it back with money it has and to and insult to injury pay it back with interest? Are you kidding me? The thinking that an organization can simply create money by pretending to lend money that it does not have and then expecting to have the pretend money paid back with money that someone has plus interest in my mind is criminal and is a big problem.<br>It is also a big problem when governments go into debt by borrowing money from a bank that creates the money by entering the amounts of the loan on a balance sheet or into a computer and now the government is in debt to the bank and has to pay the money back with interest.  There is absolutely no way a private organization like a commercial bank or even a central bank should be allowed to “pretend” to lend money that it does not have. They should only be allowed to lend money that they actually have!<br>If money really needs to be created by simply printing it into existence or by entering numbers onto a balance sheet or into a computer, the government should be the only authority allowed to create this kind of money for the  nation and they can do this without putting anybody into debt.  The idea that governments need to borrow this kind of money from private commercial banks by the banks giving out fake loans by pretending to lend money they do not have by simply entering the amounts onto a balance sheet or into a computer and  then the government has to pay it back with interest is a scam and criminal! The government does not need to go into debt by borrowing a bank’s pretend money. The government can simply create this kind of money on its own without putting anybody into debt!<br>It is often said the government should not be in the banking business but in reality the banks should not be in the government’s business. It is also often said that if the government is allowed to create all of the nation’s money there will be hyperinflation because the government will not be able to discipline or control itself on spending. There does not seem to be any limit to how much money the government can borrow which is also money created but from private commercial banks instead of the government. So my thinking is whether the government creates the money themselves or has the banks create it, if the government is not able to discipline or control itself on spending it does not matter if the government borrows the money or creates the money themselves they will cause hyperinflation. <br>When governments allow the banks to create money for them when they borrow it from the banks or if governments just create the money themselves, if organizations, corporations and businesses and even entrepreneurs can make as much money as they can then governments need to be able to create all the money that organizations, corporations, businesses and entrepreneurs can make.<br>Weather it’s governments or businesses or somebody taking out a home or car loan, the only chance these fake banks loans have of ever being paid back is if the economy is continuously growing.  Creating money by giving out fake loans forces the economy to grow. Throughout history all money that was created this way eventually became worthless as a result of hyperinflation which destroyed the economy and the wealth of the nation. The idea and thinking that the economy always has to grow for humans to progress and to be successful may also be the problem. Presently if the economy is not growing, it is considered a failure. This type of thinking cannot go on uninterrupted on a finite planet with finite resources. There needs to be flexibility in the system for the economy to expand and contract and for a contraction to be considered normal and not a problem. For this type of thinking to work, there needs to be some new economic models developed along with some new types of money and financial systems based on economic sustainability not on economic growth and on creating money by giving out fake loans.<br>One of biggest problems with politicians and political parties weather they are from the left or from the right is that they are not honest and lie through their teeth. Many of them are also tied to criminal organizations. It’s not only politicians that are on the take and cannot be trusted, many businesses, and financial institutions including banks and entrepreneurs are also on the take and participate in criminal activities. <br>I am hoping that the explosion of information technologies like the internet can help and inspire all human life on earth to live together in fair, peaceful and sustainable ways. Unfortunately information technologies like the internet can also make it easier to spread false and fake information and help inspire division and hatred against other humans, other cultures, or other nations. The outcomes are really never predictable."

4419,"Nick Giambruno (Crisis Investing, Diversifying Political Risk, YOUR Plan B, Cannabis Stock Intel)",Nomad Undercover,"George, one thing to keep in mind is that outside of the Western world, many countries don&#39;t have the same rule of law. For example, the government of Georgia confiscated all &quot;agricultural&quot; land from foreigners in 2018, but how they defined agricultural land- that&#39;s all land not located within a large city. It sounds crazy, but many people had a house and garden, and lost ownership of their garden because that&#39;s now &quot;agricultural land.&quot; So be careful. I also know stories of people who had their banks abroad frozen as well, and this seems to happen more often in non-Western countries, again because of rule of law culture. When you buy property and opening banks in the far abroad it&#39;s important for people to keep in mind how vulnerable they are to the whims of the governments."

The Democratic Party is pretty much a soft focus, smiley faced Fascist Party.  They&#39;re pretty much meeting in the middle.  For an interesting read, check  out The Vampire Economy, published in Germany in 1939 (available on the Von Mises web site).

4518,The Economy Is Collapsing! (Here's How To Fix It),Tartan Sojourn,"Australia is a great example of Government malpractice in the economy. Australians have become obessed with investing in houses. This has meant individuals and banks have gorged themselves on mortgage debt. Each time a crisis hits the Reserve Bank and Govt create more fiscal and monetary policies to keep the housing market afloat. When covid hit many Australians were about to go bust re high mortgage debt, but the Gov gave massive amount of fiscal stimulus to keep the property market going, banks introduced mortgage holidays, which are still going and Govt paid peoples wages. Now we have created another property boom, even though we are already at astronomical levels. Meanwhile Australia has little productivity and its wealth is based on debt. It is very sad to watch and the longer this goes on a lot of people will become financially ruined, but all is good as long as the herion is flowing."

4567,Silver: Will Price Boom Again Or Continue To Crash!?!,S R,"Here is why George is wrong and why paper price manipulation is not sustainable and a short squeeze is inevitable.<br>What people have been missing is the underline risk of paper silver and price manipulation and it is the fact you can find silver in too many indispensable products.<br>The same oz of silver is can be used to make 2 cars, 1 hybrid. 1/2 Electric or a single solar panel. that&#39;s the same silver that can go into a silver cotton wire and colloidal silver. Price is a mechanism that regulates demand and uses and once it is distorted long enough shortages are soon to come, and by looking at unallocated silver and even pool allocated, stories, there is hardly any silver left.<br><br><br>Paper silver can be made in infinite amounts but silver production is very limited. in fact, if every person on earth would only inspire to hold a single oz it would take a decade for production to meet the demand while no car or any other electric device would be made during those ten years.<br>An average silver stacker holding 1000oz silver is holding the future production of 500 Teslas worth between $17.5M to $62M  it is as simple as that. once the shortage will bring industrial production to a stop paper silver would lose all its value within a single day and new price discovery would have to be established and I suspect that $500 would only be a shortstop."
4568,Silver: Will Price Boom Again Or Continue To Crash!?!,Aunt Pookie,Why would you apply a direct correlation of GME to Silver?  Otherwise a good discussion of the imbalances in the system that have turned us into gamblers and not investors.  If I have to gamble its on PSLV and his simple hypothesis that money printing has to drive up the price of precious metals and anything else perceived as an asset with intrinsic value.  There are plenty of &#39;investments&#39; that won&#39;t be perceived this way when things set to reset.

4649,GameStop/Wallstreetbets Fuel Hyper Bubble: Explained (This Doesn't End Well),George Gammon,"Note: I think many people are missing the fact that the volatility in GME or any of the other targets is helping hedge funds on net balance. Sure it hurts a couple but aren&#39;t there countless others seeing the action and buying calls? Or just selling short at a higher price, front running the Robin Hood retail crowd? Yes, some Wallstreetbet people will make a killing, but so will hedge funds and Wall st (you think guys on the JP Morgan trading desk aren&#39;t playing this vol?).  The problem is many retail investors that pile in will lose because they don&#39;t know how to handle the volatility. In the end this benefits a few in Wallstreetbets but even more on Wall st."

I figured out if I make same amount of expenses I will never save money so I increased savings to 40K and reduced expenses by huge amount paid off debt . Now after 3 years I saved 200K but I still believe that federal reserve policies are destroying our savings so I started buying gold and farm land. At least I would be able to eat"
4660,GameStop/Wallstreetbets Fuel Hyper Bubble: Explained (This Doesn't End Well),Mac Stone,@Sarwar Khan Well this were you are badly mistaken.   America has out source it manufacturing to China.  So China is PPI is a leading indicator of were America might be heading.   So is their CPI.  That why told you don&#39;t understand economics.   You might well get a monkey and a dart board you will would do just as well picking stock at this point.
4661,GameStop/Wallstreetbets Fuel Hyper Bubble: Explained (This Doesn't End Well),Sarwar Khan,"@Mac Stone you think the us economy is growing ? You must be kidding . I don’t care about China 🇨🇳, I have no investment in China except alibaba shares which I own a few of them and don’t care much about it . Other than that I am concerned about my $ investments not China . The us is growing because of extensive inflation and we consume less and less goods every year . If you don’t believe me check the numbers , the Chinese can now leverage petro Yuan as an alternative because of contract with Iran and can use that as weapon to destroy the hegemony of $. That to me is really really concerning and I have to hedge against any huge decline in $. In Zimbabwe people literally had millions of $ but can’t even buy a load of bread 🍞 with it , is Us next ? With the way they have been spending more than likely . But let’s wait and see . They don’t have too many options left now . Did you even see reverse Repo? I mean why would they do reverse Repo? Why not tighten ? The answer is Simple they can’t raise interest rates . If you think they will ever raise rates you must be kidding buddy . The signs of hyperinflation are already here"
4662,GameStop/Wallstreetbets Fuel Hyper Bubble: Explained (This Doesn't End Well),Mac Stone,"@Sarwar Khan Look Khan take China, the government of China confirmed that growth was slowing, but the stock market in China is still going up?.   That market manipulation."
4663,GameStop/Wallstreetbets Fuel Hyper Bubble: Explained (This Doesn't End Well),Mac Stone,"@Sarwar Khan No Khan, you can&#39;t take the word of these cranks.  Gold is a rival to to Chinese Yuan and the US dollar.  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️   Khan you need to learn economics.   China and the United State will never allow gold to rise because of inflations concerns.   That why you need more education."
4664,GameStop/Wallstreetbets Fuel Hyper Bubble: Explained (This Doesn't End Well),Sarwar Khan,@Mac Stone also he’s not just saying to buy gold only . What he’s saying is predicting a $ crash followed by sovereign debt crisis which you never saw that is why you keep investing in what you are . When you see it let me know how does it go for you.

So I feel like everyone is screwed, really you have to wait for the transition to a new economy. All of the things we have now has just been made up by people as a abstract system which we over complicated to facilitate bargaining. This will get replaced by another similar system or maybe something worse assuming we don&#39;t figure out a proper solution.

As always, the institutions need to dump all the equity that they bought trough corporate buybacks with taxpayers money from QE 1-2-3-4..... This whole thing with WSB is a mayor warning signal IMO. Wall Street put a couple of smaller hedge funds on the line to get this story pushed all over the world, causing an irrational investing frenzy among retail investors. Just go to the Reddit Page of WSB...They are not in for  the money, they say! They are proudly calling them selves &quot;retards&quot;, holding the stock till it goes to ZERO, because they are &quot;fighting Wall Street&quot;. Think about this for a second! This is the narrative that is now being placed trough every news outlet. In the mean time- the Market Maker of the Call Options for Gamestop (JP Morgan non the less), played this whole thing in the background and made billions of Gamestop as well. I´m pretty sure the losses of Citron and other smaller Hedge Funds that shorted Gamestop in the first place have been covered several times. But the effect of this---&gt; Zero interest Rates, Stock Market at AHT, Retail Investor Frenzy &quot;fighting the Wall Street in their own game&quot;, people being desperate to earn some money on the side because of the Lockdown.. A PERFECT INVIROMENT to dump all the equity on the retail investors AND BLAME THEM FOR CRASHING THE STOCK MARKET in the process!  &quot;Fighting the Wall Street&quot;... yeah right.. just puppets and useful fools in their game who will loose everything in the process. The irony of this whole thing is just unreal !!!! To actually manipulate the average Joe into believing that &quot;being retarded so cool, because you fight the system that way&quot;... my Good, people truly deserve what they are doing to us, and they just prove it over and over again !!!!!!"

(Or maybe living in la bella Colombia has made you unaware of the reality here in the US)I guess you missed the first hr of hedge funds manipulating media and purposely pushing short selling to make money on the terminal ill GME stock supported by Big Gov killing their business with insane restrictions. This is what they called “Business as usual” . You missed to understand this investors, “It is not about the money for them” they believe in “free market” but realized their lunch has been eaten by the left- big gov mob. So this is a “punch back” they really don’t care to loose the money and are holding the line to infinite squish the bully back hedge funds. They don’t care if other make a buck or more, they are determine to wait till interest kill the hedge. I am shocked you not even mentioned the danger to the free  market the fact Robinhood manipulated the market by blocking buys but allowing sells of the GME stock to drive price down! How is that not part of one of your famous “3 simple steps”????

Was even stopped by the police with my partner on our way to the in-laws house some 20 kilometres away; we were ask a litany of questions in the process.

4709,Jim Rickards: New Great Depression Coming!! (How To Prepare),Neville Taylor,"I saw a article on the internet which listed the 10 biggest global industries, a lot of those industries were car related, car manufacturing, car retailing, car parts and after market service. What if it was part of the WEF carbon emissions reduction agenda that eventually people won&#39;t own their own car? If predictions are right where you will only need to phone and a autonomous uber will pick you up and drop you off and because of financial necessity people mihht gradually migrate out of car ownership, the costs of owning a car are huge, purchasing costs, loan servicing costs, registration, Drivers Licence cost, vehicle maintenance costs, insurance costs, parking fees, apartment buildings have to leave one vacant parking space per apartment. If living costs go up significantly then autonomous uber or just uber will be considered as a money saving option to owning a vehicle. A counter argument to that is the incredible electric vehicles popping up in cities everywhere, people are really embracinh these rental electric scooters,  though unfortunately not the safety helmets provided, fear of cooties? Rental electric bikes, strange electric skate boards and rolling balls you stand on,  if you could ban the big vehicles for safety everyone could zip around in electric mini cars slightly bigger than a gocart.The carbon emissions produced from mining minerals and manufacturing  to make the conventional ICE and EV  vehicles might be reduceable by reducing the number of vehicles, most privately owned vehicles are only used for one to two hours time a day. If you could stagger the job start and finish times or more worked from home autonomous uber could replace many privately owned vehicles."

Now the currency is not anchored to gold and 99,9% op people don&#39;t even know how money is created or what money is.<br>So in a reset after a hyperinflationary event or crisis, the Gov, will just make up a story that the sheeple will blindly accept, because they will be desperate for a new money ( medium of exchange ). No need for gold or any hard asset to back it up. Just the Gov saying, this is the new money and it is worth this amount.<br>I would just not be so 100% sure that they will back the new money with anything else but &quot;trust&quot; in the government."

OF COURSE they think that, that’s what an incompetent person would think. Meanwhile (and obviously) the competent people can’t say the competent thing to say. It’s not ok to say that ivermectin is 100% effective against Covid and we’ve known this for some time. In our society, that’s what a tinfoil hat Ted would say. Makes sense right? Test my hypothesis.

4938,Announcing The Trump News Network!! (Shocking Intel Revealed),Ty Gorton,"People perceiving that Trump represents &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;real news&quot; is pretty hilarious. It was during Trump that the clearly false cooties narrative was allowed to decimate the economy, during Trump when we got the first stimmy check, during Trump that obviously harmful and experimental vaccines were sold and funded... and on and on. The simple fact that Trump BRAGS about his role in the vaccine rollout should be enough to alert people that he is NOT the answer to anything. He&#39;s in the club and always has been, and he is not going to fix anything; quite the opposite, he will serve once again as a massive distraction while the criminals run away with EVERYTHING."

4943,Announcing The Trump News Network!! (Shocking Intel Revealed),Blaize Guerra,"I think its a little disingenuous to say that Trump increased the debt by 25%. The government did not get smaller, and I don&#39;t think Trump had that card in his hand to play. That is, I don&#39;t think shrinking government was ever a realistic first term goal. Shifting the directions of where government directed it&#39;s energy was feasible. The trend of big government spending continued because virtually every establishment politician had been corrupted by special interest money at that point.  The executive branch isn&#39;t a dictatorship. You wouldn&#39;t expect him to get much done if Stimmy Kimmy is a senator, and now your trying to takeaway her stimmy checks. Unfortunately that was the system he had to work in."
4944,Announcing The Trump News Network!! (Shocking Intel Revealed),Blaize Guerra,"Around the age of 30 when you have experienced about every single sensory input possible and can no longer gratify your self with the frivolous, is when you start becoming useful to obnoxious extent.

All money centralized by only one bank, the People&#39;s Bank of China....which does not have to answer to shareholders meaning it does not have to get a return for loans.  It means it can loan at any interest rate it wishes, weaponizing money - for example, zero interest for strategic loans and requiring the use of China labor or equipment.

Well, who is really getting a good deal in this trading: China works hard to produces all kinds of products that the US consumer wants to buy.

Mortgaging everything to the hilt and throwing it all in the stock market during the 2020 market drop was one hell of a call.  If it was a free market I think that would have been just the begining and Kevin would have got smacked.  Like George has said in the past - If you are playing black jack and your cards are showing 20, if you ask to be hit and get an ace, did you really make the right/smart decision?  I suppose with a 7 figure income you can afford to take some risks though."

5029,Meet Kevin vs. George Gammon (Real Estate/Entrepreneurship/Success Secrets) #Value Bombs,GGR TheMostGodless,"Kevin makes it sound so easy, but taking those first few steps where you basically put all your money into a home or business takes brass balls... I bet he HAD a lot of sleepless nights, chewing on his nails.... LOL<br><br>Many have plans and good deals in their hands, but taking the next step of ACTING ON IT is a horribly BEAUTIFUL experience, which you appreciate a few years later when everything worked out alright, because the rule is that most times it doesn&#39;t.  I wonder how many times he would have tried if it didn&#39;t work well the first few times??  With his character NOW it seems he would have kept at it until he made it."
5030,Meet Kevin vs. George Gammon (Real Estate/Entrepreneurship/Success Secrets) #Value Bombs,GGR TheMostGodless,"I do not know if it is essential but all billionaires I know here on YouTube have the billionaire &quot;aura&quot; or &quot;air&quot; or &quot;attitude&quot; and Kevin here doesn&#39;t have it, too fidgety or jumpy... If that aura is necessary he needs to develop it or fake it until is real or whatever so he can take the necessary steps for that level, he seems like a guy who deserves that position, and if he can keep SOME of his honest niceness about it while becoming that next level person, all the better. He is and could be a great example and inspiration to keep on going.  HE doesn&#39;t have it yet, but I BELIEVE it can be created. <br>In the end I wish him the best, even if he has to lose his persona of NOW to become a billionaire."
5031,Meet Kevin vs. George Gammon (Real Estate/Entrepreneurship/Success Secrets) #Value Bombs,GGR TheMostGodless,"@Impact Miniatures <br><br>Lots of assumptions in the last half of your answer... I never said it works for me, but I did say that IF THAT IS NEEDED and if he wants to become one, then he will need to develop it... I like the guy, he is driven. I didn&#39;t say anything he doesn&#39;t already know. Wish him the best... in my case, I did leave the place of birth and later the people there, I guess if you are born middle class or whatever then you don&#39;t really have to do that, but if you are born in what is now called &quot;extreme poverty&quot; then you have to make harder choices than if you never had REAL struggles just to be fed or clothed etc... I was glad to leave that behind. That is how I know that you must change some or a lot to get to another level. Once there I guess you can choose like you recommend since the basics are taken cared of. <br><br>Good luck."
5032,Meet Kevin vs. George Gammon (Real Estate/Entrepreneurship/Success Secrets) #Value Bombs,Impact Miniatures,GGR TheMostGodless I accept that that works for you.   I have found my life keeps getting better every year because of the people I have already met and avenues opened from them.<br><br>Leaving behind everything just to move forward sounds lonely and the type of life view that ends up when you are older regretting those choices.
5033,Meet Kevin vs. George Gammon (Real Estate/Entrepreneurship/Success Secrets) #Value Bombs,GGR TheMostGodless,"@Impact Miniatures <br><br>Well, I said  &quot;I do not know if it is essential...&quot; because IF HE WANTS TO KEEP ON GROWING, <br>Hoping that he stays as he is now just because YOU feel he could be one of you in a pub... I rather he does whatever it takes to become as big as possible IF HE WANTS TO and perhaps (as I said) he keeps his niceness, but in the end I said he deserves to be bigger, he has earned it. EVEN IF HE NO LONGER CAN HAVE A BEER WITH ME IN A PUB. <br><br>I go by the maxim that Whatever got you here, won&#39;t get you THERE.<br>And that applies to thinking people and places... I have had several chances of proving this is true. If you are born poor you must leave those people behind, that thinking behind, and most likely the place behind... besides it is impossible to keep the same people or thinking if you start reading actual books of INCREASING difficulty in any or all areas of learning."
5034,Meet Kevin vs. George Gammon (Real Estate/Entrepreneurship/Success Secrets) #Value Bombs,Impact Miniatures,I hope he never gets that air.  I watch him because I feel like he is someone I could know and go pub with.   He openly talks about being very happy with his current wealth.   I think he would rather have millions and happiness vs a billion and a YouTube air.

5072,Housing Prices 2021: Boom Or Bust!?! (My Prediction Revealed),Water Bug,"Price does not define a bubble. Looking at history is dumb if you don&#39;t also look at population. We&#39;ve been making people but not making land. 2008 was a bubble and one reason we&#39;re not in a bubble today. The last bubble took out a lot of buyers. Many have rebuilt credit, saved money and have been buying. Millennial witnessed the 2008 crash and have been not wanting to buy but now we&#39;re seeing millennial buying. Look at the chart of new homes. It&#39;s been way below historic levels. They&#39;re ramping up but it takes time. Low supply, plenty of buyers...not a bubble. It may turn into a bubble if investors move even faster into home buying. But for a 2008 type bubble we&#39;d have to see some way for the masses to get their hands on cheap money. Lenders for the moment still remember 2008. Fannie and Freddie are limiting investor properties.Seems like mortgages are prudent at least for now."

5075,Housing Prices 2021: Boom Or Bust!?! (My Prediction Revealed),Sun Lite,In a nut shell; we are screwed. I paid 8-1/2% mortgage in 1974 and my wages were poor. I bought less than I could afford. At that time the economy was &#39;lazy&#39; . Today the economy is shattered for the common man. Wages are not reliable enough to sustain a mortgage. Sending your spouse to work to back up the mortgage won&#39;t work because she/he is already working!<br>The question is is housing affordable if the rates were zero. I think the real problem is that the living wage is disappearing.

5077,Housing Prices 2021: Boom Or Bust!?! (My Prediction Revealed),Anne-Lise H,Why not issue variable rate interest rate loans instead of issuing high rate loans? If there is inflation wages will also rise to somewhat keep up. Governments need inflation anyways in order to tax the fake gains.
5078,Housing Prices 2021: Boom Or Bust!?! (My Prediction Revealed),Portland Puppets,"A few factors no one is factoring is population growth, limited building labor and supplies combined with more disasters. Demand will likely out pace supply for years to come...to the extent that it doesn&#39;t matter if there is a high number of unemployed and a high number of under paid employed. This may look like a bubble but it&#39;s really a new norm driven again by increased population and limited resources. Very few of 2000 - 2007 characteristics match the present and I predict, for a few significant reasons, there will be less foreclosures in the next 5 years than in the past 5 years."

After that, the Automobile became like a boat, it was big, bulky, had a lot of interior features, but in general mostly pieces of junk, and the design was mostly a fat man concept. General Motors seem to lead the way, government funded what a surprise. Look at our government funded programs and you got pieces of crap. Rail system, airports, space program, astronomy, earthquake, and satellite systems. Hey, was it government or private, that brought the space program for America back in play. Now monetary, medical, government decision on who can run a business or not. Do any of you really think that a small shop has more virus than a Target, Kmart, Sams Club, or any other big government backed business, you know, lobbyist giving the jabronies politicians money under the table.

The point you made about the trade offs between these lockdowns and a laisser-faire approach is something that is almost impossible to discuss with friends and family. Most people, even now, after watching the catastrophe caused by the political management of this situation, are fatalistic and refuse to follow this line of thought. They&#39;re afraid of the obvious answer... Also the fact that critical and opposing ideas are severely censored on all mainstream media platforms is also an enormous issue. Too many people unfortunately need the reassurance of authority figures to validate what they feel or have a strong intuition about.

The problem is Western society still feel it is okay to gather in small groups and spend hours or days with each other while asymptomatic.  Why can places like China hold massive parties and have crowds in the streets and restaurants again?  They locked their people in their homes and follow government instructions early in the pandemic, and we did not, because our leadership gave unclear instructions that half the country choose to ignore good advice.  So here we are."

5187,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Danny,"My path to financial independence was a little different than yours George and it’s taken me a little longer than you. I was well into my forties when I first started to learn how money is created. At first, I could not believe it. This was not what I was taught about money in my younger days. Once again, I felt foolish and also betrayed by the system and started questioning why all the “smoke and mirrors” about money. To me the most stunning realization was that modern money is created by issuing loans (creating debt). The idea that money is created by issuing loans (creating debt) never occurred to me and did not realize that most money is created this way including most of the money government spends. <br><br>Creating money from debt has been accepted as a legitimate way to do business in the free market but I suspect that if the privileged and elite individuals that invented fractional reserve banking would have been honest and transparent to the public on how it worked, I suspect that most of us including most businesses and entrepreneurs would not have accepted it. Since the system is partly a scam and has characteristics of a sophisticated Ponzi scheme, it does not seem like a legitimate way to do business. I am sure that we can come up with a more legitimate system but until that happens, it is important to learn how the current debt money system works and try to use it to your advantage. With information technologies like the internet, it should be easier to learn about how they work a lot sooner than I did and with guys like George explaining this stuff it makes it easy to learn."

Take something like wood for a home.  Even 30 years ago, it was quite labor intensive and expensive.  With advances in technology, most wood is literally grown in even rows and sizes.  Also machine usage has increased dramatically.   Yet, the price in 1981 was 150 per TBF, now it is 800 per TBF.  I can only guess if we had to create lumber the same way, it would be 3000 per TBF.

5461,"Danielle DiMartino Booth (Janet Yellen, MMT, Real Estate, Everything Bubble, IPO's, Pension Funds)",Ian Nicklin,"Inflation appears to be ripping so high so fast that we have Weimar-like effects in the system in the U.S.: Order flows for lumber and PVC are reversing backwards in the supply chain - wholesalers are trying to buy back orders before they leave the lot at a higher price than the order was sold a few days prior to a customer, because another customer would offer a higher bid.  This order flow locks up the supply chain, increasing scarcity, and exponentially slowing down supply, exacerbating price appreciation.  Once this effect becomes widespread amongst all supply chains, it creates a feedback doom loop, squeezing supply towards zero - this effect is unstoppable until the eventual collapse of a currency, like with the Weimar republic, and why hyperinflation causes starvation. Other notable effects: Used cars are becoming scarce, and are selling for a premium above brand new cars because new car prices aren&#39;t updating fast enough (I can buy a used 2 year old Audi RS/5 with 6,500 miles for 5% higher than I can order a brand new RS/5 - in 2019, the used RS/5 would have been 15% cheaper).  Basically, the rate of real inflation is moving ahead of the surface value/inflation of the dollar.  This is not to be taken lightly, it did not happen in the 1970s&#39; U.S. inflation where order flows never reversed.  Trillions and trillions and trillions of dollar-demoninated bonds and dollars are already doomed because investors are slow to realize this phenomenon is occurring and will not be willing to hold a note paying less than 3% when it&#39;s realized the currency is fading 20% annualized.  Once dollar/bondholders react, you, the person reading this, won&#39;t be able to either.  When this happens is anyone&#39;s best guess, but the process is accelerating more rapidly by the day at this point. The deflation thesis is looking dead wrong.  Danielle&#39;s mention the fed is unaware of the inflation risk and rate of inflation, and Lyn&#39;s thesis that inflationary potential is incredible, appear to be correct.  Snider and Van Metre are accurate as far as the paradigm up to about February 2021 are concerned, but miscalculate (a kind word, they have an almost total lack of real world macroeconomic knowledge) how rapidly Americans want to spend their money when the economy reopens.  We have a 30% increase in broad money supply year over year, 25% permanent shortfall in the service sector from businesses dying due to forced lockdowns, and a hungry consumer wanting to return to normal: essentially demand mirroring 2019 levels with a 50% real loss in supply.  The dollar should at least inflate 100% before reaching equilibrium if not a single bondholder or granny with a stack of CDs panics.  But it&#39;s more likely the dollar will collapse, dragging Americans and the global economy into an inflationary depression."

As a matter of fact, EBITDA is a non US GAAP concept that dates back to the 1970’s and John Malone.  But generally speaking, you are spot on.  Its purpose is to add back non recurring expenses; as to paint a better picture by saying “these expenses do not happen all the time, thus they shouldn’t be considered”.  As a Controller for many startups, one of the uphill battles I encountered during my professional Accounting career is to liase with CFO’s whose background is not Accounting.  Most CFO’s background from these Startups is banking or finance; and that alone represents a huge challenge between doing what’s right and/or doing what looks better....if you catch my drift."

5587,Student Loan Forgiveness: Economic Boom Or Economic Bust!?! (Answer Revealed),Leonardo Canelon,"The student loan forgiveness is pure politics to basically win more votes and to rescue the banks since students are struggling to pay those debts. But, at the end these students will acquire other debts like house and cars, etc, which will pump the housing market bubble and other bubbles, so it will be &quot;food for today but hunger for later&quot;, like the comunists in other countries do. Other millenials like me, will invest all in Crypto = Future."

5589,Student Loan Forgiveness: Economic Boom Or Economic Bust!?! (Answer Revealed),Christian Anheluk,"I disagree Greg. I think it&#39;s plausible that student loan forgiveness goes straight to stagflationary bust. You are correct that millenials don&#39;t have access to high paying jobs but deleveraging their balance sheet may not cause them to rush into more consumer debt. Student loan forgiveness will cause the price of tuition to skyrocket and may cause some frothiness in certain and limited housing markets, but it will destroy the value of all college degrees except for the most advanced stem and legal professions. Student loan forgiveness will not improve access to high paying jobs. It will not drive wages which is the main driver of inflation and growth. It can only cause bubbles to inflate in education prices and certain asset markets. But the debt the government will accrue to offset these student loans will cause deflation because it means higher taxes unless the federal reserve monetizes it which so far it has demonstrated unwilling or incapable of doing"

I mean essentially by the feds printing money to more or less prop up asset prices and the stock market literally saying that future generations are paying for the previous generations investments or as I like to say speculations.. I wish everybody would get it through their thick freaking skulls that the stock market is volatile it&#39;s meant to be you&#39;re not always designed to make money and investment is a gamble you&#39;re gambling on that company to do good if that company does bad you lose money you don&#39;t have the FED print and stimulate and prop up bad investments with future generations hard-earned money that&#39;s taxation without representation!!!!!! Should be completely and utterly illegal and our officials are not doing their jobs.. going to be hilarious when millennials gen xers gen z just decide to stop paying taxes until these political and corporate entities start doing their jobs and fix these corrupt problems..

5756,"Chris Irons (Fed Insanity, Lockdown Hysteria, US Econ/Stock Market Disconnect)",Ivan Poljasevic,"@Nomad Wizard Having taken care of a 40 year old healthy fit woman needing hi flow oxygen without any past medical history and coughing and struggling to breathe, I was convinced by what I saw with my own two eyes that it was very different as in more severe than the flu or even a severe case of asthma or COPD exacerbation. Where the flaw in treatment is: you have to wear an airborne precaution N95 with gloves and gown that you know how to put on and take off as well as disinfect in order to reduce the risk of spread when you are within 6 feet of a contaminated area (not just person as it can exist on surfaces for hours). Covid 19 also passes the blood brain barrier making it much more severe than the flu and stays in the body (in some studies for over 3 weeks) after the symptoms have subsided. The vaccine is a protein removed from the virus itself, it is not alive but as your body recognizes the foreign agent it works to develop immunity which does not mean that you cant get the virus after you&#39;ve had the vaccine (it only improves your chances of fighting it off). It takes several cycles for the virus to mutate and there are already mutations of it in existence. The small face masks people wear when walking into a store are a bare minimum for protection like social distancing. Regardless the financial effects of the virus will be felt fully within the next 3 years. Each stimulus uses the previous one as a base to service debt while adding more and it turns into a perpetual EXPONENTIAL cycle. Just one of many exponential factors we have converging around the same time. Got my hunting license. Have to be able to bring that deer on your shoulders if all else fails. Food for thought :-)"

No and I repeat no state is completely free of the virus. Corona viruses have existed for millions of years and always will. To suggest no one here has the virus is false for two reasons. One most people who get it are asymptotic ( have no symptoms) two, not every single person has been tested to prove they don’t or haven’t had said virus. If you haven’t test everyone how can anyone make such a false scientifically baseless claim. I, nor no one I know demanded the draconian lockdown measures our servant masters ordered on our freedoms. Again a false claim by you. And you say life and the economy are back to normal ? Hang on .... businesses destroyed, suicides and depression through the roof, unemployment everywhere ( don’t believe govt stats either as if your receiving govt support, your not counted as unemployed even if you have lost your job ) wake up mate. I’m here living it your not so pull your head in. And if your so scared and submissive, stay at home, but let everyone else get on with their lives and mind your own business. Fear your governments - Not the virus"
5758,"Chris Irons (Fed Insanity, Lockdown Hysteria, US Econ/Stock Market Disconnect)",Joshua Lizard,"It sounds to me like you&#39;re the one who doesn&#39;t know your history.  I&#39;m not gonna explain again atm the differences between capitalism and socialism as those two systems were originally intended but what about Lybia?  Mommar Gaddafi&#39;s good deeds were also too numerous and miraculous to adequately list. But he certainly wasn&#39;t murdering his own people like they told us one every news station in the West. He was so beloved by his people they threw him, spontaneous parades when he drove around town. Gaddafi raised the Libyan standard of living from one of the worst in the world to the best in Africa and better than most of Asia by far. He did the same for the schools and hospitals of his nation and every Libyan citizen received free education and free health care. And if they needed advanced schooling or treatment which Libya’s teachers or doctors couldn’t provide, he would pay for them to get it abroad and then come back home again. If they needed a loan, he gave those too, with no interest. He gave every Libyan mother a $5,000 dowry every time she had a child. And he gave every Libyan family a free house with free electricity... and free water... In the desert!!! He made the whole desert blossom and bloom and he gave everyone everything for free. <br><br>How did he do it?  By creating the most decentralized form of a democratically run government that he could fathom.  <br><br>I am not for the record advocating socialism.  Socialism puts an inordinate amount of power in the hands of what could easily become an overly despotic state.  And since power usually does corrupt, that is exactly what such a state will eventually become.  <br>But the solution is not in a different economic system.  The solution is in a system of government with the least amount of centralized power and control"
5759,"Chris Irons (Fed Insanity, Lockdown Hysteria, US Econ/Stock Market Disconnect)",Joshua Lizard,"Gaddafi also devoted his life to ending exploitation and fighting against tyranny, first within Libya’s borders which he had secured in a bloodless coup and then on behalf of his neighbors. When he attempted to take out Washington’s vicious and brutal puppet dictator in Sudan, Ronald Reagan dubbed him “the Mad Dog of Libya” and tried to have him assassinated. After several other and more triumphant battles against oppression and failed assassination attempts, he set his sights on a source of oppression that transcended borders and was felt around the world… the injustice of a fiat monetary system and the corruption of the US Dollar. <br>But when he united all of Africa under what was to be a single gold-backed currency, they called him “the most evil man alive” in every news source in the West. They invaded his country first with Al Qaeda fighters and then with NATO air strikes which left his son and two of his grand children dead in their destroyed house.. And when he surrendered under a white flag, they sodomized him with a hunting knife and shot him in the back of the head while all the politicians in DC cheered. <br>Stilll we can learn a ot from what he taught.  <br>Long live the late great saint Mommar Gaddafi.<br>May he not be forgotten.<br>May he yet be avenged"

5764,"Chris Irons (Fed Insanity, Lockdown Hysteria, US Econ/Stock Market Disconnect)",Daniel Ben-Avraham,"Here is a little critical thinking exercise, if the world was living in a 1970&#39;s economy, with a fairly weak intelligence system, low technology and a deeply religious world that hates communism, would the covid exercise had been at all possible? No way, we never could have even pulled this off in the 90&#39;s. The world populations never would have fallen for it until now. It took internet and social media and years of prepping for the mass psychosis to take full effect. For a person who worked in the counter intel industry back in the day, all this is obviously nothing more than a textbook psyop. When people ask me why I don&#39;t play the game, I simply reply that unless the organizers decide to re-instate me and pay me to be an actor, I choose to just stand by and laugh at the stupidity of the masses. It is a riot watching deluded minds as they discuss with all seriousness what is equivalent to leprechaun tests and pink unicorn viruses.

Welcome to the retirement economy. Retirees don&#39;t want debt, don&#39;t want big houses, don&#39;t need two cars, don&#39;t need a bunch of clothes and consumer clutter to fill a big house, need healthcare more, sell their investment properties and go to cash reserves, bonds and safe stocks, Invest in retirement, buy or rent a retirement condo in Happyville. Causes Deflation in many areas and inflation in others as demographics shift to an older society. The problem is no one wants to allow the rest of the economy to shrink in GDP, so Government has to prop things up by assuming more Debt to build things, keep people working, support old people programs, all to make up for loss of demand from Boomer retirement. Every developed country in the world has same problem, including Japan and China. Cervesa sickness targets who the most, the unproductive/non workers. Hmm."

5841,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Klaus Karpfen,"George, you still don&#39;t realize the full scope of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a store of value, a unit of account, it&#39;s the spirit of money in its purest and most refined form. But - and this is something gold does not do as well - it is also an exchange system, it is a banking system, enabling far distance transactions, where your gold bars might be lost or confiscated. It&#39;s the first completely impartial monetary exchange system without an overseer, an overlord, capable of creating a relationship on equal term between participants. The key words are &quot;distributed&quot; and &quot;peer to peer&quot;.<br>Actually the paradigm shift from gold to Bitcoin is about the same as the paradigm shift from heathen worship of an idol made of canvass, wood or gold to worshipping the spirit that&#39;s represented by the idol. Bitcoin is the spirit of money cast into digital numbers.<br>For anyone who wants get educated on Bitcoin - watch: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8R71WGO3qU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8R71WGO3qU</a>"

So is &quot;civil war&quot;. So letting the USD become worthless is in some ways like saying the &quot;economy&quot; no longer exists. My point is that USD may have passed (I believe it has) the point of &quot;belief&quot; in as much as the concept of USA is a belief. Comparing USA and USD to Zimbabwe is illogical.

5961,The Real Estate Guys (Real Estate Market Deep Dive...Buy/Sell/Hold?),AtlanticIslander,"Lower rates obviously make higher priced homes cheaper on a monthly basis vs higher rates. But buying right now implies that you will stay in the house at least 7-10 yrs, which is actually rare, or that you hope prices will continue going up and up, from lower rates; but we’re near rock bottom so how likely is that? But there’s also a natural ceiling to what people can pay monthly, whether that is rent or mortgage but I know that most people in general are terrible at making financial decisions. And residential RE only looks in the rear view mirror to price things so the onslaught of defaults and bankruptcies aren’t even being considered by useless RE agents. I used to listen to these guys but they pretty much always say the same thing, which doesn’t seem to take into account any impact from the worsening financial position of industries, companies, and people; the banking system is so interconnected that there is no way that this doesn’t reverberate through the rest of the system. So buying at all time highs while everyone expects the party to continue unabated seems like a rather amateurish position to take."

The Bond King says they cannot use it as collateral to create more loans as it&#39;s NOT legal tender, Jeff Snider adds and says it&#39;s only a safer and more lucrative asset swap because the banks don&#39;t like treasuries as the yield is really low and inflation is a risk for returns, he also adds the FED pays a PREMIUM to the banks for BR and that makes the BR more attractive to hold instead of treasuries.

In the first step commercial banks buy treasuries with &quot;real money&quot; (not with bank reserves), so The Government gets &quot;real money&quot;, banks get treasuries, and bank reserves get transferred from commercial banks accounts at the FED to the government&#39;s account at the FED.

It wasn’t in bank to start with and it’s gone somewhere to buy the treasury, so it has to end up somewhere in the real economy. I am realist, if this sounds stupid, just ignore."
6039,"Is ""Money Printing"" Set To EXPLODE!?! (Helicopter Money - Part 5/7)",George Gammon,"How can something go somewhere that didn&#39;t exist to begin with?  There&#39;s nothing in you bank account, it&#39;s a record of what the bank owes you.  When you buy the billion dollars worth of treasuries the bank no longer owes you the billion dollars.  The billion worth of bank reserves go into the TGA from your bank&#39;s account with the Fed.  The deposit in the real economy is gone, money in the real economy has effectively been destroyed. <br><br>Think of it this way.  You give the bank a gold coin and they give you the IOU.  You give the government the IOU and they give you the treasury.  The bank gives the government the gold coin.  Only difference is the gold coin never existed, when you opened your account with your bank you opened it with IOU&#39;s you got from someone else."

In step number 1) you have the Fed owing $100 dollars to bank A, and $100 dollars to bank B, The total Liabilities are $200 dollars for the Fed. and the total Assets for the banks are $200 dollars. $200 = $200. In step number two, when you look at the ledger of Bank B, it has $200 in assets, clearly written by yourself. and Bank A has $100 dollars in Assets, Like you said in the video &quot;On the feds balance sheet, it starts with with bank reserves $100 for bank A, and $100 for bank B. those are on the asset side of the commercial balance sheet liability on the feds balance sheet&quot; This quote is at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZFdrKV1x4&amp;t=4m30s"">4:30</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoZFdrKV1x4&amp;t=4m50s"">4:50</a>. In step number 2, The fed has $200 in liabilities, bank A has $100 in assets, and bank B has $200 in assets. that means $200 in feds liabilities, covers $300 in bank assets which doesn&#39;t make sense.  <b>**What becomes the asset of the Fed to create the additional bank reserves for Bank A?**</b> Obviously I know that the loan is made up &quot;fugazi&quot; pixie dust. However, when joe goes to take out his money he isn&#39;t expecting to receive a paper that says it&#39;s a loan for $100 dollars. he is expecting to receive his cold hard cash. The way I understand it, is interest is what allows this system to keep functioning because of the fractional reserves, so in this example I think you would need 10 more people paying 10% interest on $100 dollars every month with bank A, for them to be able to cover the new loan they promised with JOE. idk man your going to have to explain how $200=$300."

6125,"Is ""Money Printing"" Set To EXPLODE!?! (Money Creation - Part 2/7)",Global Bridges,"TOTAL BULLSHIT George, no bank on the front side creates currency out of nothing. ONLY Tier 1 banks create funds against a REAL Tangible asset (Gold, land, in ground mineral rights etc) stored on the backside system, book entry only / off-ledger assets (Drawing Rights) in the Federal Reserve System. So in their FED off-ledger accounts. These off-ledger funds can only be created for a purpose (allocation number) like loans to grow the economy, government programmes or project funding, with out a purpose to create the funds you will create too much inflation. These off-ledger funds are then drawn upon from the front side systems to ledger them onto a bank balance sheet. The allocation number plus Drawing Rights number have to match up at all times on every unit of currency in every currency, otherwise the system sweeps the funds off the front side systems. <br><br>So if a bank did what you just described without a matching off-ledger unit of funds with an asset backing them on the backside system, the funds would not be free and clear to transfer to another banks system, so would be declared fraudulent. Because you do not know about the off-ledger funds and assets, you think any bank can create funds out of thin air. However talk to anyone that works in back-office clearing systems or Tier 1 banks dealing in off-ledger funds or assets (144A securities exemption), you will see this other system that really controls the creation of funds against REAL Tangible assets."
6126,"Is ""Money Printing"" Set To EXPLODE!?! (Money Creation - Part 2/7)",michael s,"INFLATIONISTAS vs. DEFLATIONISTAS - WHY THEY DISAGREE:  They disagree because one side or the other does not have a basic fact right. And here is the basic fact that they disagree over, and neither side seems able to cite an authoritative source that will settle this question:  Will the US Treasury sells it bonds for broad money only, OR will they accept EITHER broad money (M2, maybe M3 as well) OR bank reserves? Can a primary dealer or other buyer purchase US Treasuries with BANK RESERVES or do they have to use BROAD MONEY ONLY? Because bank reserves are  not part of the broad money supply.  IF the Treasury Dept. will sell its bonds for bank reserves, then QE really is debt monetization. But if  it will not, then QE is not monetizing debt, since bank reserves will only be injected at a point where they will be trapped in the banking system.  The two sides virulently disagree on this matter of fact, and I have not seen anyone cite an authoritative source (such as an official publication of the Fed or IMF, or a high ranking representative of the Treasury Dept. or of a primary dealer) that would (or should) settle this debate once and for all."

THey&#39;d be long gone if competition is currency wasn&#39;t illegal. Which is why it IS illegal. Govts want their monopoly over money so it can keep feeding itself with monetary expansion instead of raising taxes -which would lead to an uprising.

And if the world continued to believe it held good value regardless of knowing that, it seems contradictory.<br><br>But then again, lately I have seen thousands of liberal commenters on Youtube, that must have seen all the same fishy things going on in the news reports, yet they all still claim the election was perfectly fair and even the most secure in U.S. history, so I guess it is not so far fetched for people to believe two totally contrary facts simultaneously after all.  If the worlds population of older than 10yrs old is like an American Democrat, than I suppose they could easily know the presses never stop and more printing solves the current issue for a time, yet also believe the Dollar holds a decent amount of Value.   Yeah, sounds reasonable to believe that could be the case I guess.<br><br>I was also just trying to get at the fact that our Government speedily printing Funny Money, would be something the Gov might have rather kept under wraps for fear of instant collapse of the Dollars value"

If gov can run overdraft of $1T, that means their account is negative. Fed now has more assets than liabilities. Then gov gives ppl stimmy checks. Deposits and reserves go up by $1T. Now feds balance sheet matches with liabilities, because the TGA is still on negative $1T. Think about it."
6220,MMT: Stephanie Kelton Interview REACTION! (Shocking Insights Revealed),Lee Taituha,"Hi George. It&#39;s MMT troll here.  How bout don&#39;t call it MMT, and just call it &#39;What actually happens.&quot; Maybe that will help your subscribers understand what happens in &#39;real terms&#39;.  Or maybe, see the only restrictions on societal development are the available natural resources communities are willing to use, and the skills and capabilities available (Human Capital) to produce goods and services from the available natural resources. So the requirement could be to specifically plan out development that produces new goods and services that are needed or desired, therefore reducing the potential inflationary pressure that any investment might cause.  Non inflationary development through thinking before issuing the dollars.  Or another example might be, Health Care Investment, where an investment keeps the producers healthier to produce, and the consumers healthier to consume goods and services, a nett 0 inflationary outcome. How bout maybe look at things that way?  &quot;If we can do it, we can afford it&quot; view of life with a non-convertible floating currency, were the environmental/natural and human capital being finite,  but the currency purely &#39;floating&#39; with the devlopment, we can run out of stuff, but not the currency, a real deficit of stuff of course, but not a deficit of electronic numbers on a spreadsheet."

6223,MMT: Stephanie Kelton Interview REACTION! (Shocking Insights Revealed),John Lingenfelder,"I like the overview explaining this point of view, however...<br>since reserve requirements for banks fluctuate, the example of $5 in deposits at the banks is presented that there is a $5 liability for reserves on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet. This cannot be correct, especially now when the Fed reserve requirement is 0%. Would you expand/clarify on this point, because it&#39;s clouding the remainder of your argument (in my mind) and hence, vague.<br>Thank You."

6226,MMT: Stephanie Kelton Interview REACTION! (Shocking Insights Revealed),Cecilia Moncada,"Concept below..I come from Venezuela, so my REAL experience is that yes the flaw is astronomic hyperinflation...USA=Venezuela 2 with MMT...?<br>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is a heterodox macroeconomic framework that says monetarily sovereign countries like the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada, which spend, tax, and borrow in a fiat currency they fully control, are not operationally constrained by revenues when it comes to federal government spending.<br><br>Put simply, such governments do not rely on taxes or borrowing for spending since they can print as much as they need and are the monopoly issuers of the currency. Since their budgets aren&#39;t like a regular household&#39;s, their policies should not be shaped by fears of rising national debt."
6227,MMT: Stephanie Kelton Interview REACTION! (Shocking Insights Revealed),SkillzwhoKillz,"So the MMT people think that in an inflationary environment, they will just raise taxes on a population that is already struggling to afford the increasing prices of goods and services. I&#39;m sure that will go over well."
6228,MMT: Stephanie Kelton Interview REACTION! (Shocking Insights Revealed),mark collins,"This entire video is a misrepresentation straw man gas-light. The Title alone is bogus. MMT isnt a thing to get ready for, Its a description of how federal spending works. Its unfortunate the general public is unaware of a) the difference between macro and micro economics; b) that capitalism is an economic tool not a description of all economics; and c) that what they perceive as one set of rules for the rich and another set for everyone else is an outcome of the rich understanding (not necessarily knowing)  what a and b mean. One in the MMT community claims that there are no constraints to spending. Stephanie challenged that bogus claim in her book. The constraint is available resources. But, the orthodoxy lies about how, when and why inflation may rise. They use an out of date gold standard model rather than a truth that Japan has already proved to defy their premise. Why lie? Because they want the public to think that is only safe to create liquidity through their private sector lending. All the while, they are cornering the government contracts. They want us to think they are the only ones qualified to supply the currency issuer. Just read Kelton’s book. It’s not a long read."

Yup, it&#39;s f hard to truly understand all these crazy mechanisms.<br>One thing I&#39;d like you to discuss regarding MMT (which I also think is crazy) is possible other reasons of why the MMT folks are trying so hard to push their agenda:<br>1. I&#39;m from Denmark, where the dollar has already come down quite a bit. Insane US money printing could also be an attempt to be more competitive reg exports and manufacturing jobs ?<br>2. Other currencies are linked to the FIAT dollar. Will they have to follow the US MMT agenda, or will they fall short and let the dollar fall even more ?<br>This will hurt an export economy like Germany alot i.e....<br>3. Free markets =&gt; maximum prosperity =&gt; maximum consumption of energy and materials, which many (Greta Thunbarg i.e.) tries to convince us is a bad thing ?<br>Could the hidden agenda be to lower our consumption and limit our spending to &quot;save the planet&quot; ?"

You are being very biased, inconsistent, and you interpret the facts from a totally wrong perspective. If you are an entrepreneur, please stay there, and do not talk about the financial industry. Since when are business and economics the same thing I just cannot understand? You as a businessman should recognize that employees make the business but the business in a &quot;rebel capitalism&quot; (read shareholder&#39;s capitalism, that the right economic term) is run by the management board. Therefore the economy is the management board and the businesses make the economy.

6350,Billionaires Give DIRE WARNING To Average Investors!! (Are YOU At Risk?),NegatingSilence,"Dumb question: why does inflation cause deleveraging?

6352,Billionaires Give DIRE WARNING To Average Investors!! (Are YOU At Risk?),M Wiz,"Another take:  gov borrowing creates money supply, which drives all these prices into nosebleed territory.  Look at the %GDP debt ratio going into 1980 and then out of 1980.  Look at interest rates as they correlate to the amount of borrowing by the .gov.  Higher money supply drives bond prices and stock prices higher.  &quot;Fiscal responsibility&quot; makes money harder to find, thus driving interest rates up.<br><br>Deflation means higher bond rates (lower prices).  Price of bonds is merely &quot;what return can I get?&quot;  If it covers inflation, then great, but if not, it is better than zero.  Thus &quot;inflation fear&quot; is not correlated with bond rates, other than inversely, due to money supply excess.  Opposite happens in deflation.  To think of it in traditional terms, during &quot;inflation,&quot; cash is trash - you want assets.  During &quot;deflation,&quot; cash is king - you don&#39;t want assets.  Cash is king because everyone needs what you have, thus the price (interest rates) go up.  Everyone else has what you don&#39;t want, which are assets, thus those prices go down."

I sold out and made £2,100 profit, oh dear, I was crap, had I held that £784 would be worth £32,500 as at 24th December 2020 but it is very, very risky, you might (and can) lose 100% of your investment, and never ever buy on margin, Eurasia would have bankrupted you, because the shares were suspended in 2020 for months, before coming back with a bang.<br><br>Do not buy Eurasia now, but do your homework and there are jewels to be had:-)))<br><br>PS my next holding might save your life, and be in Science fiction films, in a few years time?"

Your eyes will fail and your life will waste away. You’ll plant in vain, because your enemies will consume what you plant. 17 I’ll set my face against you so that you’ll be defeated before your enemies. Those who hate you will have dominion over you and you’ll keep fleeing even when no one is pursuing you. 18 “If, despite all of this, you still don’t listen to me, then I’ll punish you seven times more on account of your sins. 19 I’ll break your mighty pride. I’ll make the heavens to be like iron and the ground like bronze. 20 Your strength will be spent in vain, because your land won’t yield its produce and the trees of the land won’t yield their fruit. 21 “If you live life contrary to me and remain unwilling to listen to me, then I’ll add to your wounds seven times more on account of your sins. 22 I’ll send wild beasts against you from the open country to deprive you of your children, destroy your cattle, and decrease your number so that your roads become desolate. 23 “If, despite these things, you still won’t return to me, but live life contrary to me, 24 then I’ll certainly oppose you. I’ll take vengeance against you seven fold on account of your sins. 25 I’ll bring the sword against you to execute the vengeance of my covenant. When you gather in your cities, I’ll send a pestilence. As a result, you’ll be delivered into the control of your enemies. 26 When I destroy the source of your bread, ten women will bake bread in one oven. Then they’ll return back your bread by weight. You’ll eat but won’t be satisfied. 27 “If, after all of this time, you don’t listen to me, but instead live life contrary to me, 28 I’ll oppose you with vicious rage. Indeed, I myself will punish you seven fold on account of your sins. 29 At that time, you’ll eat the flesh of your sons and you’ll eat the flesh of your daughters. 30 I’ll destroy your high places and cut down your sun pillars. Then I’ll cast your dead bodies on top of the bodies of your idols. I’ll loathe you. 31 I’ll lay your cities to waste and destroy your sanctuaries so I don’t have to smell the scent of your soothing odors. 32 I’ll make the land so desolate that your enemies who live in it will be astonished.” 33 “I’ll scatter you among the nations and draw the sword after you so that your land becomes desolate and your towns become ruins. 34 Then the land will finally be pleased with its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate while you are in the land of your enemies.

They&#39;d be much happier moving everything to just Bank Reserves domestically and then being able to stimulate lending autonomously.

6405,"Will Financial ""BIG BANG"" Trigger Derivatives Market Meltdown?!?! (Conclusion)",Jim James,"Which begs the question; what did the FED do to trigger it? Unless you are referring to the ongoing SOFR initiative. I may have missed an announcement of more QE, FED bal sheet has been pretty flat for a while. One of your guests had a good theory as to what is driving the market. Weak dollar=CB money printing to buy US stocks as a currency hedge. That is the only thing left. I see no other reason for this market to be going up. I mean in addition to the info u have outlined, the asset price to disposable income is very bearish also. I need to subscribe to your service."

I was not entirely aware.<br>But there are multiple effects:<br>- Short term:  if the interest rate is lowered by Sofr then the prices for derivates will go up.  In parallel, more credits are issued thru<br>  Eurodollar system.  FED losses control over the USD.<br>- long term:  Another level of control is required.  Digital USD?  With a digital USD there is not USD created without knowledge of the FED.   In my view this is what to expect that Central banks starting to control their currency again.  But what will happen <br><br>What will happen if the USD M2 is not 18Tri ?  and they find out that all outstanding USD M2 are 50 Tri.  <br>They will argue that with a digital USD they regain control over the currency.  But increasing the risk for repro market.  A potential solution could be that instead of repro Market each and everyone gets an account at the FED (digital USD) and repro becomes an official FED controlled market."

With covid project, riots and destabilization of hot spots just bulletproof arguments to make this marriage happen?"

So let&#39;s say Deutsche bank has 100k US dollars on their balance sheet. They can now give out loans in US dollar, and as we know that&#39;s how money is created in a fractional reserve banking system. So eurodollars are normal dollars but out of the control of the Fed."
6415,"Will Financial ""BIG BANG"" Trigger Derivatives Market Meltdown?!?!",Lynn Wood,"So we went off the rails Sep 2019, and the Fed has barely been able to hold on.  The Central Bankers plan is to de-link the American domestic Federal Reserve dollar from the Bank of England created dollar and the European Central Bank created Eurodollar because domestic American dollars are not fungible with eurodollars ( including the dollars created by Bank of England) Each area has to be able to set its own local interest rates.<br><br>So...and just how much longer can the dollar be maintained as the international reserve currency?<br><br>Uh, and the derivatives based upon these dollar denominated loans and instruments with expectation of the Federal Reserve to keep the system liquid if the derivatives jam in unzipping when structurally the Fed does not know how many dollars exist and the subgroups are not fungible.<br><br>Oh boy...<br><br>Uh...yeah...I might just have to give up 38 years of sobriety...."

6476,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Midas Haltzern,Bitcoins tech is old and inefficient. The only reason why it&#39;s the most popular is because it was first and best known. The digital currencies will see Bitcoin as competition and a threat and will regulate it to obscurity. The Digital dollar legislation is already gunning to regulate cryptos. This is backed by the federal reserve which is the most powerful financial entity on earth. They work with other world central banks and can bring nations to their knees. Bitcoin and friends don&#39;t stand a chance. Enjoy it while it lasts. There&#39;s no safe place for it to hide in the developed nations.

6489,"Eric Siu (Digital Entrepreneurship, Financial Freedom, The Economic Red Pill Journey)",Michael Fish man,"Failure is one of the stages to success, I believe every successful trader made a lot of looses when they started trading. I lost so much money when I started but I was lucky enough to link up with Mason Luke a professional trader who currently traders for me, he’s a great trader honestly and he only charges a 20% commission which is a reasonable bargain. So my advice to you is, get yourself a trader and study how he/she trade for you. Or better still connect with Mr Jason on Instagram @Jason_real.fx for assistance"

6504,"Eric Siu (Digital Entrepreneurship, Financial Freedom, The Economic Red Pill Journey)",Fusion,"I definitely can&#39;t explain it in this format, but we&#39;re all making a big bet (which I think we&#39;ll win) that the Antichrist - oops, I mean, the corrupt politicians and federal reserve - will be unable to control it. Bitcoin is extremely decentralized and resilient, and basically protected by an encrypted wall of energy, which opponents erroneously criticize as wasteful. I say erroneous because that energy cost is what makes it unassailable, and you need your most valuable possessions to be unassailable. <br><br>Alt coins are any of the other crypto coins, and there are currently around 5000 of them, and most have lost / will lose all value. The reason is, we don&#39;t need 5000 different coins. Bitcoin is still in development, and it always will be, and the technological improvements made by alt coins will be incorporated into BTC, if they are worth it. So, all value flows back into BTC. <br><br>Ethereum is a pretty solid contender in that respect, and it does something BTC currently can&#39;t do (I would argue, shouldn&#39;t ever do), which is smart contracts. Almost all applications using blockchain are run on ETH. It&#39;s probably a solid investment, but there are contenders cropping up, such as Cardano ADA. <br><br>After the above mentioned coins, you can definitely make money, but it&#39;s more of a gamble. Just be aware that money flows back to BTC, and never trust a coin to stick around in the long run."

To the government, to banks, big companies and small ones. The system only works if we play by the rules but when we leave people (with their own self interest) alone with power and money, corruption happens anyway. Then when people who aren’t playing by the rules get higher profits without getting punished (because we can’t track where their money is going (politicians, illegal activities)), the good guys can’t compete. We need a balance between profits and ethics but in today’s society, ethics don’t pay the bills. Ethics should come first. From what I know, A lot of companies do not want to move towards renewable resources because it costs more. They rather let their pockets stay full while the environment crumbles. I understand and appreciate everything you teach but I do see a lot of “worse case scenarios” and this new system doesn’t necessarily have to go down that route. “There are no solutions, just alternatives” and this current alternative is apparently out of juice."

I would venture to guess that you are not a programer and not a technology geek.  You are mixing  a lot of apples and oranges and a few lemons all together.  First bitcoin is a blockchain which makes it digital because it run online.  2nd you are talking about smart contracts that are not bitcoin.  Entirely different you can only program money with a smart contract and the only way to do that is by building it on a public blockchain so that the contracts can exchange information which makes them completely transparent.  What your suggesting is incredibly difficult to do because each function must be programed into the currency and they all needs to talk to each other.  The beauty of bitcoin is it stores value and solves the double spending problem.  You are correct the smart contract digital currency will be the way out of the current financial crisis but it will be much different than you described."

For instance, have 1 currency unit equal 0.0001 gold (or something), thus doing away with all the number scheme confusion. How would that not be operable?

I get the impression that the rich elite think they create their wealth by being the rich elite; ie printing money for themselves, and all of the other self fulfilling corrupt practices they deal in. Dont they wonder why world economies are falling apart? Don’t they care about the widening wealth gap with poverty increasing particularly where wealth is concentrated with the few? The rich just don’t care; the politicians are there to feather their own nests and their rich mates.<br>When it gets too bad in their own front yards they will start another war.<br>Have they thought to increase wages (I dont mean free handouts that trap people in poverty and political game playing) and cut taxes. This is the best solution. People will then have more money to spend and economies will grow at the “bottom” instead at the top.  The greed at the top must stop."

6662,"Martin North (Real Estate, FedCoin, Banking For All Act, Auto Loan Bubble)",Rob,The problem with tax cuts is this:- They need to be accompanied by government spending cuts to be effective. If they are accompanied by deficits funded by Treasury bond sales to the Reserve bank those bonds are a future burden to the taxpayer since they mature (requiring a payout)  and if one follows the money trail properly one will see that the only source of revenue to pay for them is TAXES which fall on the private sector and that means ordinary taxpayers.

Good information from Martin and very relevant questions from George. <br>One additional big factor that is missing is the imapct that stamp duty is payable on housing sales in Australia and this puts another obstacle in the way of people changing houses to go from a house they no longer need to a smaller house.

Central Banks are the enemy of the people, the economy and our way of life. Everyone should go Listen to JFK speech (April 27, 1961 - New York City)<br>President John F. Kennedy address, &quot;The President and the Press&quot; delivered before the American<br>Many things  STARTS TO MAKE SENCE after this.<br><br>Here is a snippet  &#39;&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.<br>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.&quot;&#39; <br>The Banks and Governments and powers that be have a lot to answer for, but as individuals so do we, when one day we may have to look our children in the eyes and explain why the future was sold off at their expense and did nothing about it, except comply."

6699,Will The REAL ECONOMY Ever Recover? (Shocking Answer),Greg Collins,"PM&#39;s or fiat? the ideal is somewhere in between.  PM&#39;s are too rigid in a growing economy - but fiat is not rigid enough in the human hands.  Remember the goal is stable prices!   In a growing economy with a fixed quantity of PM money, prices drop.  In any economy with fiat money, more of it is created and prices rise.  The best would be a fiat currency regulated by the price of PM money.  Unfortunately, this simple method is always corrupted by manipulation, so my vote is to go back to the imperfect world of honest, hard money."

Way overpriced, but I thought it was going to continue to get worse so I bought when I did,  at 4.5% 30 year fixed.  In 2010 I refinanced my 30 year death contact (The literal definition for mortgage) into a 20 year 4% fixed loan for $500 closing costs, no change in monthly payment.  Fast forward to 2013 and I got a 15 year fixed for 3.5%, $500 closing costs, $70 extra per month.  This past July 2020, I want to an 8 year fixed at 2.625%, $80 extra per month.  I will be done paying the loan off in 6 years and 9 months as I have always payed every other week.  So I turned a 30 year death contract into a 20 year death contract (2007-2027, assuming all is good) and saved a couple hundred thousand in interest payments.

I had a question about the the Case-Shiller index. If viewed through the price of gold the same spikes and dips can be seen but there is not an equivalency of the current market to the 2008 crash. Far from it it is much below the 2006 spike. I know houses are not bought in gold but understanding how gold functions vs fiat what logical conclusions can be drawn from this? I&#39;m honestly asking for help as you have a great breath of knowledge on this subject. thanks in advance.

This is exactly why Facebook and Google collect data and the Chinese CCP collect information and create files on 100,000&#39;s of people.  An older law was based on Mathew; those that have will be given everything and those that have little will have nothing.  Approximately the square of the number create output or actually drive a business; the square of 100 is 10, the square of 1,000,000 is 1,000, but it gets worse with larger numbers.

A similar pattern was witnessed in Paris with respect to the launching of the famed &quot;Yellow Vest&quot; protesters.  It&#39;s all about &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot; vis a vis a metaphor of Freemasonic social control organized around the metaphor of Star Trek&#39;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; as &quot;The Great Work&quot; of &quot;The Master Architect&quot; framed in terms of the outcome portrayed in the image of &quot;The Borg&quot;--i.e. the hive mind of the Bee-Org.  Seriously, this IS a conspiracy theory.  And any who seek to &quot;debunk&quot; the assertion by way of the application of such a term of inquisitorial hyper-violence need to be told to go back to the children&#39;s table and shut their stupid rotten filthy little traps.  This inquisitorial method of anti-reason--&quot;debunking&quot; via an epistemologically invalid standard of inference so as to signal thinly veiled death threats--defines the speaker as a programmed drone, a so called &quot;Murder Hornet&quot; as it were.  Nothing but trash, a population that engages in such abuses of reason, jurisprudence and pathologization of speech and does so in collaboration with the violence of the psychiatric-Nazi police state deserves to be burned in piles.  Today&#39;s nornhole is nothing but a witch-hunting psycho who deserves to be fleeced of assets and gassed, which is the intended outcome of the entire ritual anyway.  The inability to see the ghost in the machine--the great &quot;conspiracy&quot; as initiated by &quot;The Master Architect&quot; of &quot;The Reich&quot; as &quot;The New World Order&quot;--marks us as those who in accordance with historical precedent, choose to Nazi.

6838,"Sahil Bloom (401k Crisis, Pension Collapse, Risk/Reward Private Equity)",Nathan Brady,"Hey George - The reason why some 401k plans have very few investment options is because they are cheaper or free for the employer.  The cheapest options for the employer usually include funds that the finance firm will collect a lot of fees on, so they make money off of the contributing employees rather than fees charged to the employer.  The more they loosen up the fund choices, the less they make off the employees and the more they need to charge the employer."

6840,"Sahil Bloom (401k Crisis, Pension Collapse, Risk/Reward Private Equity)",Paul McGowan,"George - I run the 401k plan t my company.  In the interview you asked the why employers only match on a few funds in their 401k plans (paraphrasing).  The short answer is - due to potential legal liability.  401k plans (deferred compensation plans) are governed under the ERISA laws (Employee Retirement Income Security Act).  Under these laws, an employer is considered a &quot;Fiduciary&quot; and must act in the best interest of the plan participants.  With this said, you have to make selections available to participants that allow them to construct a diversified portfolio at a reasonable fee.  This could be 5 funds or 30 funds just as long as the employer acts in the best interest of participants.  Index Funds and Target Date Funds are the safe choice for employers and thus dominate 401k plan investment options.  For example, many of our employees have asked about us adding an ESG option to the plan.  We have not added an ESG fund because there is no standard definition of ESG fund in the industry and an employee could potentially complain or file a law suit against us.  In addition, ERISA does not provide any protection for employers regarding ESG funds so the legal exposure is not worth the risk for us.  I am not a lawyer and this is not meant to be a comprehensive post but, I hope my explanation helps a bit."

A third of my undergraduate degree was in economics for an &quot;environmental&quot; option of International Relations. A good book on this is &quot;Environmental Endgame&quot; by Professor Robert Nadeau. Ecology now relies on supercomputers doing chaotic nonlinear iterations to make &quot;predictions&quot; - the problem being that supercomputers could care less about ecology. Late-term capitalism has been based on &quot;biological annihilation&quot; - that&#39;s a term used in a recent peer-reviewed conservation biology article. We are not only under a mass extinction crisis due to modern civilization but we&#39;re fast running out of fresh water and also abrupt global warming will soon double due to the Methane Bomb in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. <a href=""http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/"">http://arctic-news.blogspot.com</a> <br><br>So no - Western Economics is not at all like Nature. Sorry to burst your bubble. My paper for my university &quot;Environmental Economics&quot; class was called &quot;The Incorrect Supply and Demand Model&quot; - why? A good book on this is &quot;Politics of the Solar Age&quot; by Hazel Henderson - on all the nonlinear feedbacks of environmental economics. Check out &quot;noncommutative&quot; geometry - that&#39;s an accurate model of reality compared to the commutative symmetric logic used for Western science. Noncommutative geometry is also called quantum algebra - it&#39;s used for the most advanced science. Most scientists don&#39;t even know about it. <br><br>We are about the same age - I&#39;m two years older - but I devoted my life to sustainability policy. For example getting the University of Minnesota to divest $1.5 million from Total Oil for using slave labor in Burma (now known as Myanmar). The environmental raping of the planet is highly underrated - for example the Chinese regime gives out free chainsaws to AFricans to rape the virgin rainforests. Sustainability is a total joke - most people think it means to &quot;sustain&quot; profits. The whole Wallstreet WELFARE scam is gonna explode soon - the elite rich can&#39;t extract blood from rocks for much longer.

And that’s per worker, not per household.     This is an America in which 47 percent of renters are cost burdened, in which 40 percent of households can’t cover a $400 emergency expense, in which half of Americans over age 55 have no retirement savings at all.&quot;<br><a href=""https://time.com/5888024/50-trillion-income-inequality-america/"">https://time.com/5888024/50-trillion-income-inequality-america/</a>"

If I could make a suggestion, put down Economic and the Public Welfare for now. Start instead with Mystery of Banking and just read through chapter 11. The rest is historical context, you will get the same information and more from History of Banking and Money. The History of Banking and Money started as a commissioned report for Ron Paul while he was in congress, so Rothbard dumbed it down for that audience, it&#39;s a very simple read. <br><br>Regarding the exponential credit growth, all I can say is once any variable goes parabolic its usually only a matter of time before it corrects but I am retired so out of the prediction business.<br><br>One thing I should say is I don&#39;t prescribe to either of these systems, bank-dominated lending  “deposit multiplier” system or the market-based credit and securitizations system.  I am an Austrian so I stand for sound money, proper interest rate theory and free banking. All of which I would be more then happy to share with you if you like. But I don&#39;t think this is the proper form for those discussion. Not to sound creepy or anything but if you would like to email me behind the scenes I have an email address set up for this.

Plus links to schematics of the banking system, treasury and wall street…..it shows how they are intertwined. There is also a link to a schematic of the money market system with all it nuances which can be complicated.  <br><br>If you decide to accept my help, please provide me with some idea of where you think you are in your journey to discovery."

Unexpectedly glad I found you and so glad you shared your knowledge. I will definitely read the other two books you mentioned.  I have already started the first one. <br>Since the discipline is removed in your opinion would you assume the credit growth in the future might grow exponentially faster ?"
6923,"Luke Gromen (Dollar Hegemony Fading, Economic Collapse, MMT, And Social Unrest!!)",Goldspan,"@Q Palma I would not necessarily disagree with what you stated about reserves here. I would just add in the hierarchy of “money” in the banking system (or actually cartel)  reserves are the highest form of “money” (being an Austrian I prefer the word currency), followed by Fed Funds and Eurodollars which are credit with a promise to pay in reserves. In the payment system reserves are how transaction are settled once netting has taken place, but reserves are really so much more then that. In order to get the picture of today once again your have to look back in history.<br><br>1844 …...the debate between the Currency School and the Banking School was settled (you can Google these) by the Peel Act. The Peel Act basically stated that the BOE would now print the only paper money that is legal tender and the country banks could no longer issue their own private banknotes.  The country banks would become part of a system that could inflate the money supply not by issuing their own private banknotes but by the privilege of creating loans in ledger form on their balance sheets in the name of whomever wanted to take out a loan. Banks make most of their money not by net interest margin but levering their balance sheets creating loans as a ledger entry or what most people call “out of thin air”. The country bank tried to relieve this financial stress of losing the ability to inflate by the issuance of their own banknotes by levering up their balance sheet with interest baring assets through loaning deposits into existence, in ledger form only. So the country banks were now back in the “inflating” business and began creating loans and recording a liability in the name of the customer and recording an asset on the ledger for themselves. But the catch was the customer had instant access to the proceeds from the loan on “demand” hence the name demand deposits. <br><br>In order to join the system the country banks had to deposit all their gold at the BOE and since technically it wasn&#39;t cash or paper money it became what is called a “reserve”. The country bank were required to keep a minimum amount of reserves to settle transaction and meet the withdrawal of BOE banknotes by customer that had demand deposits. This is were the “required reserve ratio” came from. The reciprocal of the RRR when the banking system is fully levered up is the “money multiplier” So if the RRR is 10% then the system is leveraged 10:1. When the customer took out this loan he never intended to sit on the money and he had access to BOE banknotes instead of country banknotes to carry around in his pocket or he could carry what became known as a check book with him and just write a check to to pay for things. All the checks had to go to London to the BOE to be cleared. There payments were processed by “netting” out the differences to the different banks. Sometimes some banks had more payments going out then coming in so these were usually met with assistance by the BOE for a fee. The reason banks would run short on reserves is because like holding BOE banknotes in the vault, reserves were a non-interesting baring asset which was an opportunity loss. This help from the BOE was causing the money supply to expand as an additional source of credit in the system which is called “elasticity of the money supply” (now a days there are many forms of this help)…...the opposite side of elasticity is discipline. The discipline is like what you stated “a repayment of a loan”…not the customer but the loan the country bank got from the BOE...which can only be settled by …...you guessed it “bank reserves”.<br><br>So that provides some historical context along with some understanding of fractional reserve banking and the payment process. Key concepts as the banking system evolves from 1844 England to the U.S. in 1980. Why 1980 you ask? Well the U.S. deregulated the financial system and evolved from the bank-dominated lending  “deposit multiplier” system and imported the European style banking which is market-based credit and securitizations. This year finally removing the last of the old system with the elimination of the RRR and now we have completed the process and have “infinite multiplier” where “credit” if you will has no limits.  Elasticity abounds and the Fed has eliminated any hope of discipline by absorbing all the losing credit positions through QE by way of creating all these reserves to settle the positions left exposed to the ravages of the free market. I say let the free market do its job and liquidate the assholes.<br>If I could may I recommend two books for you both of which you should be able to download for free at <a href=""http://mises.org/"">Mises.org</a>. <br><br>The History of Banking and Money and Mystery of Banking both by Murray Rothbard.<br><br>Let me know if you have anymore questions."
6924,"Luke Gromen (Dollar Hegemony Fading, Economic Collapse, MMT, And Social Unrest!!)",Q Palma,"Goldspan thank you for the link I will read it tonight.  I definitely get the concept. Of the re discount now,  another question I got for you  would be that “bank reserves” in General are only created by the federal reserve and added to  member banks accounts when they need to cover the existing loans ?"
6925,"Luke Gromen (Dollar Hegemony Fading, Economic Collapse, MMT, And Social Unrest!!)",Goldspan,"@Q Palma thanks Q.....you can download a free copy at <a href=""http://mises.org/"">mises.org</a>. just search the title. <br><br>As far as a re-discount, let me give you an example. Back in the day, let&#39;s say around when the Fed started doing business, a company sold some product to one of their customers. The customer didn&#39;t have the money at that moment but the company really wanted to make the sale. They knew the customer well and had a good working relationship with them. So the company said I&#39;ll float you for 90 days. The delivery was made and the customer provided the company a &quot;bill of exchange&quot;. Let&#39;s say after 30 days the company was a little short on cash.....say to pay employees. The company approached their regular bank and sold the bill of exchange for 95 cents on the dollar, with a promise to pay the bank in 60 days when the customer paid them. The difference being a 5% interest charge. So the bill was considered &quot;discounted&quot;. Now the bank legally own the paper and it is non recourse. Let&#39;s say after a week or so the bank needs cash itself. They approach the discount window at the Fed, borrow dollars and put up the bill of exchange as collateral for a charge.....lets say the Fed re-discounts the bill of exchange for 90 cents on the dollar.....technically a interest charge. So, once the customer pays,  everything is unwound and life goes on. What I described is call the &quot;real bills  doctrine&quot;. Technically the Fed didn&#39;t give the bank cash. The Fed credited the bank with bank reserves. Cash and reserves are the same thing, don&#39;t lets these YouTube economist fool you. The only difference is which side of the threshold of the door you are standing on when you are talking this topic. If anyone gives you grief regarding just ask the the rhetorical question......so how does the bank get the cash to put in their vault, all Federal Reserves Notes  originate at the Fed."

7039,Tim Staermose (How To Find Cheap Dividend Stocks In Emerging Markets),Ron Randall,"Here are some excerpts from Brandon Smith article entitled, ‘Economic  War with China is the Final Step Before the Great Reset’ on 11 Sep 20 at <a href=""http://alt-market.com/"">Alt-Market.com</a>. The trade war is not designed to punish China; it is designed to offer further distraction as well as a scapegoat event for the economic collapse the central banks originally created. China’s ties to the IMF, their involvement in building a cashless society, their participation in digital currency frameworks, etc., all lead me to believe that they intend to have a large seat at the table of the “Great Reset”. With the amount of capital and technology being funneled into China the past two decades, I would not count on the establishment to then try to destroy their new favorite economic engine. What I would count on is for the current tensions with China to be increased dramatically in the next year. It seems to me that the pandemic and the riots are not quite enough to send the U.S. population begging for help from those at the World Economic Forum or the IMF. They need another crisis, and China can provide them with one. The next step in achieving this objective is to sabotage the existing financial order so that the public, desperate for stability, demands a replacement. This means taking down the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency.  This will probably result in a currency basket system moderated by the IMF being used to replace the dollar in international trade. That doesn’t mean the dollar will disappear, it will just lose a large portion of its buying power. This means trillions of dollars that are held overseas will flood back into the U.S. through various channels. Hyperinflation will result, the global economy will take a hit, but the U.S. will be hit hardest. And it will all be blamed on Trump and the trade war. They are seeking to exploit crisis events as opportunities to push their agenda."

7064,Mike Green (Passive Bubble And Extreme Volatility...Is Your Retirement Safe?),qwer123211,"There is a very important takeaway here:  The more money that goes into the market as the market becomes even more of a vehicle that is perceived to (1) Generate income as more folks become unemployed and (2) As more folks become &quot;savers&quot; and not spenders, the more the FED and the Treasury will be &quot;pushing on a string&quot; in an attempt to boost the economy where 73% of the economy is the consumer.  Since most folks now treat the market as a casino, few if any will take their &quot;winnings&quot; and buy something, most will keep plowing more of those gains back into the market at HIGHER prices until the market experiences another historical decline and they lose their money.  Two things:  (1) Go to the Vegas Airport and compare the happy faces of the new arrivals to the sad faces of those departing, and (2) Remember that a parabolic rise in the market or a stock, &quot;destroys those that bet AGAINST it on the way up, and then destroys those that bet ON it on the way down&quot;.

7065,Mike Green (Passive Bubble And Extreme Volatility...Is Your Retirement Safe?),Dan Lee,"Makes me think about my own retirement accounts...  100% allocation into passive index funds in the 401K since it&#39;s the lowest fee and just tracks the SPX and my own 401K doesn&#39;t have access to many funds.  Then in a separate IRA account which has access to more instruments like leveraged funds and options, you can sell put premium on inverse NDX/SPX funds which would lower your cost basis to own hedges on your 401K money (if assigned) or you just keep premium if the markets keep marching up... hmm lots to think about here.

Or you have boyfriend and girlfriend working shifts together. Someone can start stealing. And their &quot;friend&quot; isn&#39;t going to say anything about it, as a matter of fact they might just join them. So who steps in to remedy the situation? Someone has to make decisions, you can&#39;t convene a counsel to vote on day to day matters. This idea probably comes from someone who has never taken over a business. There are times you have to clean house, everybody has to go. In this delusional model, who is going to do the firing? The hiring? What happens when everyone needs to go. They are not going to vote everyone out. We already have a working model where the employee runs the business. That&#39;s when the employee leaves that job and start&#39;s there own business.

7081,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Blake Magee,Nothing prevents a group of employees from creating a co-op and competing in a free market if they choose to bear the risk together. Unfortunately many advocates for this tend to want the state to force their will for them because they indeed do not want to compete or shoulder risks.
7082,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Hugh Mungus Bungus Fungus,"As far as employee-owned businesses are concerned, the problem I see is origination. Usually, to start a company you have a founder or partnership that puts up the majority of the initial capital and risk to get the venture off the ground. If you want to build a coop then you have to understand that you, as the founder, will have to assume the highest amount of risk but will receive no more reward than your most junior employee, unless you set up a structure whereby the risk and reward is proportional, which is called traditional employee-employer.<br><br>I think the reason people keep advocating for this model is that they haven&#39;t ever tried to start an enterprise that employs people so they don&#39;t understand that calculation."

If there is oversupply, the same amount will lead to deflation.<br>Supply is influenced by imports, the percent of machines used, defaulting of companies/founding new companies all influenced by interest rates.  Assume 100% of your supply would come from China then it would not even matter what would happen in the US economy.  <br>With industry 4.0, we will see production mainly influenced by the cost of money (automated production).   As this means oversupply &amp; shrinking incomes this should be extremely deflationary.<br><br>A growing money supply combined with an oversupply of good&amp;services should lead to shrinking price increases and increasing asset prices.

The equation is: MV = PY where M = Monetary Base, V = Velocity, P = Price Level and Y = Real GDP.  Milton Friedman had this equation on his license plate.  You can see that if Velocity is low (which it is) and GDP is rising, you can have a decreasing price level, i.e. deflation, with a rising monetary base.  The wild card is GDP.

However, what is the best way to monitor the overall size of deposit of the commercial banks?  So, stimulus checks looks like going to have net increase. However, if people cannot go out to spend or worry about the future and keep the money in bank mostly, then the effect of the inflation will not be much. On the other hand, the shrink in overall expenditure due to pandemic may potentially have net -ve to the velocity of money then the deflation may be what we are heading to. Am I getting it right?"

We need more dialog. I don&#39;t agree with this guy. But we don&#39;t have capitalism today in the US. We have total socialism for the rich and a little for the very poor. The rest of the 99% can go fuck themselves. :)
7130,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Michael Mappin,"We don&#39;t have socialism for the rich. Socialism is about worker and Community ownership. We have today with the rich people only most of the capital, that&#39;s a direct consequence of capitalism. Capitalism is about owning for a living. Socialism is about working for a living and getting to keep what you work for.<br><br>Giving money to the rich or to the poor, that is not socialism. Social programs paid for through progressive taxation is not socialism. Socialism is about economic democracy. Capitalism is economic feudalism. That&#39;s why the rich people get most of the wealth produced by labour and why most things are made in China. Capitalism promotes extreme competition. Extreme competition results in Monopoly."

7133,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Steven Asmowidjojo,"The professor is fundamentally wrong. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WG4z2eAVMI&amp;t=9m18s"">9:18</a>)<br>Right after slavery Black poverty was steadily declining, only about 20% of black children was born out of wedlock and Black people had families and businesses. There was no socialist government intervention and most black people worked hard and built for themselves. That was until the arrogant government came out to kill all character through the welfare state (something about the road to hell being paved with empathy, sympathy and good intentions). Nowadays 75% of blacks babies are born out of wedlock (because the government says you can&#39;t have a man in the house if you want the money), black poverty is getting worse and we have broken families and even less businesses than right after Jim Crow. Three centuries of enslavement couldn&#39;t do what 10 years of the welfare state did: break the black family. <br><br>The same pattern is happening to the whole of society. <br>Socialism kills character."
7134,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Steven Asmowidjojo,@Michael Mappin I believe I don&#39;t have time to convince a grown man that socialism is bad and that it kills character. <br>Go read a history book.

7138,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Chris Strobel,"It sounds cute and all, but it seems to based on the notion that all people are equally productive which is a utopuan fantasy."
7139,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Michael Mappin,"Who said anything about people being equally productive? Socialism is about worker and Community ownership. Yes, when workers own their own company or factory, they have more equality because they have equal voting power. But they are not all equally productive. People get paid according to their contribution. The ratio between the highest and lowest paid worker generally Falls between 7 to 1. The reason it usually doesn&#39;t go higher than seven to one is because even with labor-saving technology or Advanced education, it&#39;s not possible for a human being to convert his labour energy into 7 times more wealth than another human being."
7140,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Yash Arya,"Summary of the points discussed by Richard Wolff:<br><br>----------<br>Marx&#39;s Critique of Capitalism:<br>1. Unstable - Major crisis every 4-7 years.<br>2. Unequal - Increases wealth gap between the rich and the poor. This is temporarily reversed during bursts of crises/revolutions called social explosions. This may last for a up to couple of decades.<br>3. Unjust - (Not discussed)<br><br>There are several interpretations of Marxist literature, depending on the interaction of different socio-cultural backgrounds where it spread. The common theme between them is: Use the masses to take over the state, then use the state to transition from Capitalism to Socialism. There are different approaches/models on how to take over the state.<br><br>1. German Model: Parliamentary / peaceful take over of the state. (No more details)<br>2. Russian Model: Revolutionary / violent take over (Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, etc). <br><br>Three Kinds of Socialism:<br><br>1. Planned Economy: Socialism as State Capitalism (Stalin&#39;s version) - During the communist revolution when Lenin was in charge, all peasants were given their own private property. Communist revolution established free market! So it is a misconception to think that Communism is opposed to private property. After Lenin&#39;s death, there was a struggle regarding who would be in charge. Trotsky lost, Stalin won. Recall that the initial aim of Socialism was to (a) use the masses to take over the state, (b) use the state to transition from Capitalism to Socialism. Stalin stopped after step (a) and supported the interpretation of Socialism as State Capitalism. In other words, instead of Private Employers, State was the sole employer. State planned what/how/where to produce, and what to do with the revenue.<br><br>2. Mixed Economy Socialism: In this model of Socialism, followed by Scandinavian countries, the government steps in to smooth out the rough edges of Capitalism. This includes providing healthcare, welfare, free education etc. Things that we typically associate with such countries.<br><br>3. Socialism as Democratization of the Workplace (aka Democracy at Work): This is the kind of Socialism that Dr. Wolff advocates. Here, as opposed to there being a State Employer, the aim is to get rid of the &quot;Employer/Employee&quot; relationship itself. (Wolff sees Employer/Employee relationship of Capitalism as being analogous to Master/Slave relationship of Slavery and Lord/Serf relationship of Feudalism). <br>* A group of people democratically own the enterprise. With one person one vote, they decide what to do with the factors of production and how to redistribute the net revenue.  These are called WorkerCoops.<br>* This is still private property. It is simply democratically owned.<br>* Instead of there being an employer/employee, there is collective self-employment. <br>* The government gets its revenues from such WorkerCoops instead of from the minority of rich people making all the money.<br>-----------<br><br>My questions/comments:<br>1. In a Democracy At Work type of Socialism, would a group of people have the freedom to voluntarily engage in Employer/Employee type relationships? <br>2. If the answer to #1 is a no, how would you enforce this? Seems to me that to enforce this you need to fall back on the threat of violence using the State.<br>3. It seems to me that what you&#39;re suggesting is a Capitalist system in which there are only self-owned-businesses, no &quot;jobs&quot;. Everyone is an entrepreneur. Everyone shares the risk and the reward. My question is, how is this seen as superior to a system where people have the choice whether they want to work in a WorkerCoop or in a regular company? Naturally not everyone has the capital to invest into the company, and not everyone shares the same risk tolerance.<br><br>If all Dr. Wolff believes in is the voluntary formation of WorkerCoops, without forcing everyone else to do the same, then he is a simply a capitalist with a strong preference for a particular type of workplace organization. :) <br><br>If there&#39;s ever a follow up to this video, I hope the above questions are answered."
7141,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),spinzaar gledhill,The real understandings are built on the paradox. Denial is the reason why any proposed system has problems.
7142,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Martin,The Swedish covid-strategy is a complete failure but he himself admitted that Sweden was socialist so his argument that socialist governments handle the pandemic better falls flat.
7143,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Alberto Forte,"Over an hour in and I feel stronger and stronger about my preference for free markets and the reason why the marxist/socialist narrative will never convince me. First of all - the fact that the Russian Revolution established private property and free markets is to say the least a distorted view of what actually happened. If you don’t know who the kulaks were and where that land ‘given to farmers’ came from, please educate yourself. And it’s particularly annoying when that narrative comes from a pompous academic who treat everybody as uneducated ignorants. They never change. They never understand that the marxian economic stability is basically stagnation. No competition, no creative destruction, power in the hands of bureaucrats and the usual things that occur in every single true marxist society. How can you mention only China and Russia (got better as soon as they introduced elements of capitalism) Denmark (always capitalist) and forget about DDR, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Angola, Mozambique, Bolivia, Yugoslavia and I’m sure I’m forgetting a few of these ‘failed experiments’ that led to misery, incarceration, suppression of freedom?"
7144,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Michael Mappin,"The type of socialism that Richard Wolff is talking about is actually more conducive to free markets and thriving economies. capitalism destroys markets. It violates basic market and economic principles. For example, one of the central goals of Economics is to achieve equilibrium. How can you do that when the goal under capitalism is to maximize profit by keeping wages as low as possible while simultaneously producing as much as possible? If you extract 50% of the wealth from workers, then the workers are only going to be able to afford half of the goods and services they put into circulation. That&#39;s just one of many contradictions regarding capitalism. It&#39;s a religion. It doesn&#39;t even make any sense. Capitalism is economic feudalism. That&#39;s why most things are made in China and why wages are so low. If we had economic democracy, which Adam Smith was in favour of, then workers wouldn&#39;t move their production to China. They wouldn&#39;t pollute their environment and water supply, Etc.<br><br>Anyway, if you really were in support of free markets then you would be anti-capitalist and Pro socialist."

7150,Richard Wolff (Better Understanding Of Marxism And The SMALL GOVERNMENT Socialist Movement),Michael Mappin,"Worker cooperatives are not capitalist. Merely selling the product of your labour is not capitalism. If you write a book and sell it in the market, that is not capitalism. If you grow vegetables in your garden and sell them in the market, that is not capitalism. At a cooperative the workers own the company and they&#39;re doing their own work, they&#39;re not utilizing someone else&#39;s wage labour for profit. If you&#39;re not profiting off of someone else&#39;s labour, then it&#39;s not capitalism.<br><br> of course there&#39;s thing stopping people from forming their own businesses and cooperative. There are many barriers. However, there are regions in Europe where 44% of the GDP come from worker cooperatives because there are fewer barriers and people have greater access to Capital. there are some places where you can get all of your unemployment insurance money up front for the purpose of study at cooperative as long as you can find at least nine other people collecting insurance. and of course you have to have a solid business plan.<br><br> if you could get the full value of your labour would you work for a company such as Walmart or Amazon for a fraction of what your labour is worth? Of course not. the vast majority of people have no choice but to rent themselves out in order to survive.<br><br>There&#39;s a worker-owned bread factory in the United States where the assembly line workers make as much as $70,000 a year. you won&#39;t see a assembly line workers making that much money at a capitalist company, because they do not own the product of their labour.<br><br>&quot;As long as he owns your tools (the capitalist) he owns your job, and if he owns your job he is the master of your fate. You are in no sense a free man. You are subject to his interest and to his will. He decides whether you shall work or not. Therefore, he decides whether you shall live or die. And in that humiliating position any one who tries to persuade you that you are a free man is guilty of insulting your intelligence.&quot; <br>~ Eugene V.

Why I&#39;ve watched this clip 4-5 times now is because of an enigma I&#39;ve had during this whole pandemic. 1/4 of the world was in lockdown so money&#39;s not circulating, negative oil prices etc. But the FED was pumping trillions into the Repo market for months before this pandemic and did the same just before the 08 GFC. The FED Repo market was the first clip of Gammons I ever watched. Have the Central banks regained control and capitalized from this crisis? Does the power of the commercial banks and rogue elements have to be diminished  as well as a near cashless society for MMT to be viable .

7176,Inflation Or Deflation?

They forgot to account for that cash. So, in the third step the bank would have $200 of bank reserves as Assets plus the $100 in cash that was deposited by the recipient of the deficit spending. That&#39;s inflationary. As long as there is deficit spending by the Treasury that is financed by Central bank reserve creation (i.e. &quot;monetized by the Fed&quot;), it is inflationary. Unless the recipient of the deficit spending uses the cash received by the Treasury to pay down his other debt(s). Then it isn&#39;t. In that case, it&#39;s a wash."

It started by taking Mortgage Backed Securities off their hands, and I am sure they paid them at face value when at the time they could only get pennies on the dollar. Ditto for the effort to buy those corporate JUNK bonds. What better way to get them off the hands of banks and other financial institutions and make them &quot;whole&quot; with cash. Ok, so maybe the cash is only in a Reserve, but it is again at the full face value of the security which was probably losing value had they tried to sell it. So maybe this is the plan for US Government bonds.....they buy them all up and if the time comes to default, the default can be limited to the treasuries at the FED and all that happens is their balance sheet  goes down. Indeed, the asset side of their balance sheet would not match their liabilities....but what would that mean...those unused bank assets would perhaps disappear, or would they just become real money and no longer reserves. Either way, I think the idea of QE was to sanitize unstable assets so bank balance sheets would be stable.."

Here is some more information to know, that the overall process is swallowing the real assets from the population through bailing out (the mortgage back securities and stocks as assets) this means, the fed putting them in their bs. Of cause the fed shareholders getting bailout too, but, the other cooperate assets and realestate through mortgage back securities are taken away from the owners when the &quot;expected or even planned downtimes&quot;.<br>The second important point is, during the downtime, the businesses get consolidated to less. So the poor will go poorer. Big cooperate assets or partial assets will be owned by fed/their shareholders.

I just want to share couple of my views. <br>I think there could be a huge precious metal liquidation phase coming if insolvency rate rises which I think is likely based on data. I was looking at some banks who hold these metals as an reserve/asset or even collateral for the debt issued. Those debt insolvency will force to liquidate them and who knows bank itself might need to be liquidated. That was supply side argument.  But from demand side it looks like there are significant sum of people sitting on large pile of cash trying to get into precious metals. I am one of them. I still have significant holdings in gold for worst case scenario. I think until the insolvency phase passes through we won&#39;t see significant price movements. So what are your thoughts about it. I wish I could have detailed conversation with you.<br>One comment from your great financial reset video. There are some really good bills in congress which gives me hope like this one <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5404/text?format=txt"">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5404/text?format=txt</a> and at the same time it discourage me since it is kind of dead (inactive)."

He even says that the CPI is wrong and always under estimates inflation.  So why does he say there is no inflation so often in this discussion?
7321,"Grant Williams (4th Turning, Helicopter Money, Pension Bubble, The END GAME)",Boudica X,"I don&#39;t understand Grant&#39;s position on inflation. On one hand he states repeatedly that we&#39;ve barely had any inflation over the last 12 years. On the other hand he acknowledges that the real inflation rate, as measured by the cost of living (ie. house prices, health insurance, education costs etc.) Is closer to double digits. WTF? Grant even acknowledges the reality that the CPI is rigged to artificially understate inflation and has been &quot;readjusted&quot; repeatedly to achieve that illusion. Hey Grant, pick a side. The truth is that we&#39;ve had continuous high inflation over the last 12 years (John Williams&#39; Shadowstats illustrates this quite clearly) and is getting worse. I shop at supermarkets and food prices over the last 6 months are WAY up. And that&#39;s despite very low oil prices which should have lowered the cost of growing and shipping food."

For a while I followed him as it was inspiring.  Think positive, get a second job.  Ignore the gloom and doomers.  I agree with his philosophy of real estate, hold 8-10 years and own your home.  Yes the market may go down tomorrow but the alternative is rent.  However, he’s done quite well for past 20 years on the stock market.  He encourages everyone to keep investing in easy index ETFs, APPL, and other good quality companies and just collect dividends.  This point I do not agree, eventually the market will turn.  He’s like that guy who tells everyone just cross the street, no need to be as cautious cause I’ve been doing it for 20 years."

Given than there are so many folks who have an uncertain income future (job loss, work hour or salary reduction,etc), they are not increasing their spending, but doing the exact opposite.  This deflationary force has been overcoming all of the inflationary actions by the Fed.  <br>The CPI is another farce vis a vis the economy.  If one actually deducts the “real” CPI against the nominal gdp figures, the economy has been negative for decades.  It is just that the lowering of the standard of living has now reached a critical point whereby folks are super frustrated.

7361,"Rick Rule On Future Of Gold, Uranium, Copper, Coal And More!",A R T,"Our slavery in modern times begins the moment our parents register our birth, as a result of which we receive a citizen service number.  For the State we are from now on a number to which they assign a certain value.  The total value of all of us must ensure that the Government debt can be paid back to the Banks , of course with interest.  Only that amount of debt is fictitious, because it are the Banks themselves that make this money fromout nothing and thus create debt , the whole moneysystem is built on trust.. Because State banks simply don&#39;t exist. All State banks worldwide like the FED, are all commercial banks owned by private persons. We the people are therefore the modern slaves of our time. Any government is nothing more than an instrument used by these banks to collect their debt with interest. The only thing a Government is free to decide on is to come up with all kinds of taxes with which they can pay off their national debt. That&#39;s why we facing about every ten year a crisis,  just to set the moneysystem right that&#39;s no coinscedience but a well planned nessecary thing. Thats why the Banks have also a privilege status when someone or business go bankrupt , they have after taxes the second right to collect their outstanding money before any other debtor will get their money. Well it is actually their first right because taxes will finally all ended in their safes. For the Banks it is very attractive to cause a crisis every few years for them it only has advantages for example, to get real estate cheaply and then sell it again with huge profits by strawmen. The Banks live their life&#39;s of misery, mess and bankruptcy. Therefore, it will not be long when they are going to ban all cashmoney so that everyone will be forced into a total digital money system in a fully controlled environment.  That means that every step a person takes will be traceable.  It is therefore no coincidence that the Internet was created.  The Internet is therefore specially designed for humanity to allow it to live in a fully controlled environment. Every existing recording datasystem will be connected to eachother to get your whole profile complete. All state banks are united in the International bank of settlements based in Basel Switzerland since 1930. The Vatican is one of the founders of the International bank of Settllements.  Now could that be the reason why Hitler never invade Switzerland during the WWII, despite the fact they had no army and kept the largest goldstock in Europe in their bank vaults ? Did you ever see the video where the Pope bow and kisses the hands of the Rockefellers and Rothshilds ?"
7362,"Rick Rule On Future Of Gold, Uranium, Copper, Coal And More!",A R T,"Its a comprehensive and much bigger plan taking Trump down then most people can imagine. The plan already started more then 15 years ago when Mueller was still head of the Fbi. The Deep State expected that Trump would run in 2008 for the presidency, they created a plan to protect their puppet Obama and to end Trumps political ambitions once and for all. It was a combined operation between Brennan (CIA) Clapper (NSA) Mueller (FBI) the 7th floor, the DNC and the MSM outlets CNN, MSNBC and NBC. They infiltrated several operators into Trumps surroundings like Michael Cohen. Cohen bought in 2005 two condo&#39;s in Trumps tower and introduce himself at the owners meeting which lead to become Trumps personal laywer. At that time NBC already invited Trump in 2004 to presenting the Apprentice for them. Remarkable is that NBC in 2006 organised a special edition of the Apprentice in the PB mansion. The reason was to be able to introduce miss Stormy Daniels to Trump. In this way Cohen and Daniels were able to make this extortion &quot;deal&quot; behind Trumps back. The Apprentice was also needed to create a certain bad womanizer profile of Trump. But his run for the presidency came on hold trough his newborn son. Thats why the extortion deal between Cohen and Daniels disappeared in the freezer for over 12 years together with all these false accusations from &quot; abused &quot; Apprentice women. Notice when bribing is not possible the DS will try to embarrass and compromising a opponont which is their beloved weapon to eliminate a enemy. Later in time they invented also plan B in case plan A would not work to get rid of Trump. Trump was already for many years a direct threat for the Deep State existance. Primarily because of his statements regarding the 911 attacks and the outcome of the Nisc report in 2004. Now Plan B contained the Russian hoax story for this purpose they infiltrated numerous other operators into Trump&#39;s proximity to justify later in time the Russian investigation. Thats why Muellers report contain no evidence against Trump for any collusion at all because the whole Russian narrative simply never occured. But Muellers report was written in a highly suggestive and manipulated way to give the Dems enough ammunition to start their impeachment trial. Muellers assignment was first of all to protect his own infiltrants which he all knew and second to coverup the Russian hoax story. You can easily assume that Muellers team consisted only out DS operators. Now remember how Mueller became the SC . First Sessions recusal was based on almost nothing. Sessions was actually obligated to inform the President first about his recusal. Instead to inform the President he waited till Trump was abroad and then handed the &quot;Russian dossier&quot; over to RR which immidiatly appointed Mueller as the Special Counsel. In this way they prevented Trump from any interference. Be awaŕe every upcoming political entity which could lead to become a potential threat for the DS, will be approached by their operators in a early stadium just to determine whether a person is might be susceptible to bribing when nessacary or if they have to take other measurements to bring such entity under their influence. The MSM outlets will follow his steps and report statements trough interviews during his life. In 1980 CNN was founded by the Deep State to become their private broadcast channel serving only them. CNN had to filled the need for their international worldwide ongoing operations for propaganda and support purposes but even more to coverup their own scrutiny.  CNN is the ONLY cable TV News Network in the World able to reach into every household Worldwide but also shows up in all kind of other public facilities like airports, events, cinema&#39;s, conference and hotel accommodations troughout the World. Because off having this monopoly the World audience gets a very narrow one sided view about what is happening in the World. Now realise that their own fabricated, invented or manipulated Fake News items which are exposed many times before, they spread on a daily base into the World without any correction nor excuses afterwards . This misbehavior makes CNN a really dangerous player especially for keeping peace in the World. BE AWARE  In Europe we are not capable to receive any other international Newschannel next to our own national Newschannels which get the International News delivered directly from CNN without any fact-checking take place. The keyplayer behind the Dems strategy is N. Eisen which is the creator of this ongoing &quot; color coup &quot; against Trumps presidency. EISEN is a former OBAMA aid which already acclompished 180 lawsuits against Trump .

7372,"Rick Rule On Future Of Gold, Uranium, Copper, Coal And More!",A R T,"There is also another upcoming big threat facing all people in the World. They will force us to give up our last piece of &quot; privacy and freedom &quot; when they ban all our cashmoney into a totally fully controlled digital moneysystem. The Internet was especially for that purpose invented and devolped by DARPA to be able creating a fully digital controlled environment. This is mented to be the base for their New World Order plan. To achieve such goal the banks played a important role over the last two decades systematically forcing all societies Worldwide into using the INTERNET capabilities . Thats why we see the past five years that many bankfilials disappeared from streetview more and more.  The bigger filials stay but gets only a advisary role for all other issues you must use the Internet. Thereby many &quot;smart&quot; devices were devolped and are implemented into our surroundings, like the smartphone, smartwatch, smart tv, smartcard, smartbook, smarthome, smart energymeters all using the same internet. Also cars are implemented by using GPS so that every move we make is registred, these and other supplements are all presented for our convenient or as a measurement for our safety . Like to pay to drive or for a requirement having a insurance, or for speedcontrol whereby over longer distances your speed will be watched. Also your home is already target to registrate your needs of energy which even make it possible to register if you were at home on a certain day. Every smartdevice is a watchdog of a certain part of your life but all come together in your personal profile stored in a databank where all of your history will be storaged. This Internetsystem will become the base for the New World Order. Be aware that we are facing the final stage to acclompish this fully controlled system. For this same reason the bitcoin was launched with the thoughts of having a moneysystem which is out of sight and not controlled by the normal banking system. Realise that the banks will never give up their carefully built up monopoly of their existing moneysystem noway, they are also the founders of this bitcoin system using strawmen to set this up. There is no bank in the World which gives their power away , no the bitcoin system were setup to make the other transformation into a only digital controlled moneytransfer system more acceptable and more smoothly when the people must accept to give up their cashmoney. The banks will never allow a other moneytransfersystem next to their own which also occures out of their sight , noway never so wake up. . Notice all so called &quot;Statesbanks&quot;  in the World are actually in the hands of a few private Bankersfamily&#39;s,  including the American fed. More then 55 of these Statebanks are part of the International Bank of Settlements based in Basel Switzerland. These Bankers only have one fear which is this big amount of weaponry in the hands of the American people, for the simple reason they could be used against them. Thats why they executed troughout American history false flag operations trying to ban all the weaponry from civilian sources or to force certain new legislations trough congress , like they did with the Patriot act to reduce your civil rights . Their fear is In the case that during this transition the people will start a revolt en masse before they are able to complete their final stage. Be aware they have a limited force which they can use against the American people, it well good be that many of their participants will change their minds. Because many of these participants were lured in with false motivations and arguments. After the transition is completed they will blowup the bitcoin systems in the way that the people will lost their trust in that system at once for that matter they kept big amounts of bitcoins behind and will put this amount in one time on the market whereby the bitcoin market will fall apart. The Russian hacking, interference and collusion never occured which they abused already many times troughout history this is fabricated by the Intell Agencies to justify many new regulations and to gather enough Government budgets to forfill their New World Order. For this same reason were ISIS and other terrorists groups created to support their assignment. Our cashmoney is the last piece of freedom which we can use without any controlled oversight. Be aware that nothing is a coinscedental event , liike all these so called terrorist attacks worldwide but not with the narrative they want us to believe, the real motive is spreading fear under the public to setup new regulations and laws which all pretending tol serve our safety . This NEW WORLD ORDER is the real narrative behind many wars , terrorists attacks, false flag operations and assasinations., Fraudscemes occures troughout Government to finance their operations and any other scrutiny which ask for more measurements and more regulations when they are smoothly intodruced into the society.<br>This New World Government have already almost under their controll such as education, foodsupply, medical needs, watersupply , all energy sources, transportation, the money system and all kind of other economic sources in this way they created an artificially maintained society where only those people can become rich who have been approved or employed by this organization, the rest of the people will be artificially kept at a certain low financial level to be able to serve the higher echelon, which is represented trough the Pyramid structure ."

Therefore, it will not be long when they are going to ban all cashmoney so that everyone will be forced into a total digital money system in a fully controlled environment.  That means that every step a person takes will be traceable.  It is therefore no coincidence that the Internet was created.  The Internet is therefore specially designed for humanity to allow it to live in a fully controlled environment. Every existing recording datasystem will be connected to eachother to get your whole profile complete. All state banks are united in the International bank of settlements based in Basel Switzerland since 1930. The Vatican is one of the founders of the International bank of Settllements.  Now could that be the reason why Hitler never invade Switzerland during the WWII, despite the fact they had no army and kept the largest goldstock in Europe in their bank vaults ? Did you ever see the video where the Pope bow and kisses the hands of the Rockefellers and Rothshilds ?"

7385,Passive Investing Bubble: Is YOUR Retirement In Danger? (Yes! Here's Why),George Gammon,"NOTE: I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t buy ETF&#39;s or Index Funds, just that you need to be cognizant of how the market is currently structured and the additional risks that come along with it.  Most people have never even thought about the roll passive funds have played in US stocks being wildly expensive.  If you&#39;re considering buying a passive investment make sure you understand the underlying assets very well.  Lastly, I&#39;d consider having some portion of your portfolio long volatility and in assets that have zero correlation with stocks.  i.e. gold/silver bitcoin.

7406,Passive Investing Bubble: Is YOUR Retirement In Danger? (Yes! Here's Why),Dimitri Andreou,"Hey George! Ok, this was a little wacky 😛 if $1000 are placed in a &quot;buy&quot; market order via active management or passive management, the resulting price is going to be identical. Of course! They are indistinguishable. So when you focus on capital flowing from &quot;active&quot; to &quot;passive&quot;, your premise does not hold any water.<br><br>IMO if we should be concerned about something, it should be about the inflow from cash deposits into passive mngment (due to this popular indexing ideology). So long there is a net inflow, prices are pushed up (and one should consider real prices, i.e. try and compensate for money inflation). This is what keeps overvaluing stocks versus everything else that money can buy. And <b>this</b> is what looks like a slow loving ponzi scheme. Once the music stops and there is no more positive net inflow, then all the people of the mentality &quot;if the price drops, I&#39;ll just hold for few more years and it will come back&quot; will be screwed. It won&#39;t come back."

If you&#39;re investing into index funds, you will get the average return. Even if all the people start using active strategies, it&#39;s mathematically impossible that most of the capital will get a return above the average. And if you want to keep valuation-metrics in mind, you can easily achieve it with specific ETFs. At the end, active management did not make any good job in the past. For investors it&#39;s more a lottery to pick a good active fund that brings a acceptable return for you."

Human stupidity knows no bounds. 4) In addition, if you find someone who can consistently beat the market, then damnit, get out of ETFs and give them your money! It&#39;s just not that easy to find. 5) investing is not stock speculation, you are completely ignoring demand and supply are a function of the business.

Some of my clients have exchanged into physical gold or silver via Sprout, others into stocks etc. Even got one that buys deeds of trust.

7494,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Charley Zabarinsky,"Holy Crow, George...  I&#39;ve been an investor for over 60 years and I&#39;ve invested in a myriad of assets and asset classes.  Bitcoin is the second most common search term, just after Tesla. Crypto currencies are the riskiest and potentially the most rewarding investments these days.  Bitcoin will go up in value like crazy and there are others that have real USE CASES, and which will go up in value to a greater extent than will Bitcoin.  My favorite is a coin called XRP.  You could consider this to be the ramblings of an old man, or you could check it out carefully and perhaps make 10X your investment within one year&#39;s time.  And much greater return in years to come.  Further, we never have to sell any crypto currencies because we can borrow any fiat currencies using the asset as security, at 2 or 3% annual interest rate.   We&#39;ll NEVER  have to sell, and as time goes on, we can borrow more.  &gt;&gt; No income tax if we never sell. &lt;&lt;    I have nothing to sell here.  No axe to grind.  You&#39;ll uncover &quot;new&quot; good news just about every day.   This is without question the best investment opportunity I&#39;ve ever seen. ...  Charley"

If you&#39;re going to mispresent the argument of MMT academics, try talking to one, they&#39;d be happy to talk to you. Dr. Hunt is not an expert. No MMT academic would argue that indiscriminate spending is the solution. In order for the private sector to invest, the government must establish and fund its national priorities so that the private sector can respond and support its balance sheet and the national objectives. The reason we are facing challenges is precisely because the politicians at the federal level are over-focused on balance sheet constraints instead of REAL economy constraints and inflationary constraints. MMT-informed policy would advocate for precisely the capacity building investments and funding needed to enable alignment of incentives. Its the status quo, largely due to deregulation, that has created vampire capitalism. It would be much more honest for you to say you prefer to make different national investments because of your political beliefs, because all you&#39;re doing is espousing your preferred neo-classical &quot;free-market&quot; value system and wrapping them up in defunct neoclassical economics and hand-waiving."

If Eric Sprott ends up getting in on it, you’ll be so glad you did too.  You only need to hit on 30% of these ventures to make that warrant incredibly valuable.  Good job, George!

It&#39;s like you are making the lemonade. It&#39;s tased good until you keep pouring more water until lemonade becomes water. US dollars will be like water.

Gov&#39;t inspectors do not stop fraud in the building trades. Plus they drive the cost of everything up over 30%. That 30% (or more) is an additional hidden tax on all products and that is ON TOP OF the direct taxes your are already paying.

If I have $10M of assets, probably feels good to have $1M locked up/preserved in gold, and having $1M is a lot to work with for speculative ventures.  But if someone has $100-400k isn’t it likely they’d maybe want more money preserved, and more speculative?

7798,"Ron Paul (Fed Audit, FedCoin, Cash Ban, Virus Response/Personal Liberties, And Much More!)",supertona83,"While I agree with most that they are saying, there is a general mis-definition of communism/marxism. The main difference between communism and capitalism is that the factories, companies, farms, mines, etc. do not belong to the stock holders of some corporations but to the workers in a worker co-op. There is a general association of communism with totalitarism/autoritarism but these are two different things. Totalitarian regimes can be communist, capitalist or feudalist or whatever, totalitarism simply means that that government control the total of life. Historically, practically all attempts to establish communism ended as totalitarian regimes because, firstly, they evolved from revolutions fueled by popular rage, and secondly, because these regimes had to defend themselves against very powerful international and domestic elites that did not want to loose their privileges. These elites are mainly responsible for spreading the propaganda that resulted in these two intelligent gentlemen equating communism to totalitarism.   Also the free market is not the answer because of four main reasons: 1. externalities, for example a company is then free of polluting because it gives them a market advantage against a company that invests in the environment in the short run (probably shorter than what any competition could survive) 2. there are structural monopolies: for example, rail roads, electricity cables, pipelines, canals.  Because there is only one infrastructure free competition is difficult. 3. The free market doesn&#39;t really make long term investments. For example, without government investments in semiconductors and electronics, your mobile phone would probably be as large as a backpack. It is the same reason why the US does not have a high-speed rail system like other developed countries.  4. The tragedy commons, e.g. the ocean, the earth, the air, the biosphere.  These do not charge so if they are in the hands of the free market, they will be ravaged before it is not profitable. I believe that government has a place in these four aspects not only as a regulator but also as a direct economic agent. I believe that government should not collect taxes but be as self-sufficient as possible by, for example, having government companies in control of structural monopolies or having government companies developing and selling technology instead of simply giving it away to corporations. The advantage of government companies is that it is not one stock=one vote but one person=one vote."

This is the reason why people still cue up to come.  As a good friend of mine who stayed in Europe once told me, wealth creation in most countries is almost hereditary.  Very difficult to find social mobility within one generation."

I can see your point George that is not as good as it was (which is the understatement of the century) but the United States is still the best. <br><br>The only thing the United States needs is to change back to a society similar to the 1950’s. <br><br>We have a situation that has developed as in Atlas Shrugged. <br><br>The United States has to many unproductive people.

7921,Dollar Loses Reserve Currency Status (Here's What Would Happen Next!!),dcohn99,"Considering that the Government destroyed the health of the world allowing the broken Electrification methods to continue even though Tesla knew the correct solution.  Rockefeller and Carnegie are seemingly the 😈 Devil it sure appears.  Yet imagine if they brought in some horrible Schooling ideas like those used by Hitler.  Oh I forgot.  They did that too.  So now everyone is trained to not believe that you can produce anything and more importantly they do not believe in Math or Science because, are you ready, they were taught that Math and Science are bad and it&#39;s better to believe 2+2= whatever we tell you it is.<br><br>Of course everyone can argue that no one would do such a thing.  Ridiculous to believe that.  It&#39;s like saying they made up a fake virus and told everyone to do exactly what would make them even sicker like stay out of the Sunlight and limit the amount of air they breath.  Of course at least the extra Alcohol and Drugs were made available.  They were considered essential services but anything healthy like the Gym would not only be closed but if they tried to open up they would fine them.<br><br>Hahahaha.  <br><br>The only solution after all this would be faith in God.  Well that was also made very clear as a no-no so no one has to worry about it.<br><br>We can even ask some of the people that worked in the Garment Industry not so very long ago.  Let&#39;s say 1980.  The Garment Industry was still a huge part of the US economy.  This not only brought businesses into large cities like New York and California but it gave the southern states huge capabilities to grow crops like cotton and textile plants could create synthetic fibers to add to the manufacturing base.<br><br>That is just one industry.  This was true of all the industries such as the Steel industry which was decimated earlier than the Garment industry.<br><br>In everything I have said here does anyone notice the one single thing that could be changed or eliminated completely and make the US a strong nation again.  Additionally the other nations would see the US going back to reality and they too want to be strong.   Well the answer as I assume everyone has guessed is for the people to work together with each other.  Each community could create groups of equal and  focus on helping each other.  They could split up the work such as growing food and building homes and creating a central power supply along with all the services the community needs. <br><br>There would be no losers because the Government would not exist. <br><br>The reason it is so simple is when the  Government is buying a product to distribute to the people they must create a system for each item they buy.  Since the Government is generally more or less unable to do anything without planning and meetings and rules and even making up stories about the different choices to offer people.  Just to cut to the chase when you remove the insanity (Government) from the picture everyone would work less and have more.  Plus the thing that is lost to do many is that when people are able to take part in the creation of their sustenance it brings satisfaction to each person involved.  It also creates comradery within the community.  Humans actually have a natural connection with each other via the natural electric fields we each create and when people are close together and cooperating the energy level becomes very high and happiness is just over flowing.<br><br>To put it in the money sense, though no money is needed, but the Government would need to spend $1000 to buy 1 pound of vegetables.  When Community creates the vegetables the cost is actually nothing as it&#39;s the work of the people in the community.  Yet to get an understanding of the comparitive price the 1 pound of vegetables would be around $1.00 versus the same 1 pound of vegetables that the Government bought because of all the steps they feel they must take to but that 1 pound of vegetables.<br><br>I hope that is what you were looking for.  <br><br>It&#39;s actually an old saying I believe but I forget the saying. You get what you pay for maybe.  No. That&#39;s not it.<br><br>Well I cannot think of it right now.  <br><br>Of course if people started planning such a world not everyone would agree.  That is ok.  No one is forced to agree to anything.  Those that do not want to join in can have the small piece of land that would have been a part of the community land and do their own thing.  Of course I have not figured that part out yet.  I guess some people would just not want to be loved and prefer to sit alone and complain.  We could save a few of the old Government ideas like Allopathic Health Care including Psychologists and they could discuss how unfair it is to be part of a loving communities.<br><br>Just because every example of a community that works together as a team for everyone&#39;s good has always had tremendous success is no reason to stop doing what is clearly not working for most people."

Jeff is stating that the real money supply is M3 +a hidden supply of money that cannot be estimated!! Surely the very fact that the relative value of the US dollar vis a vis other currencies is declining must be at least a signal that there are limits to Federal Reserve money printing and overstepping these limits could collapse the dollar!!"

Lower supply of available goods and the impact of higher import  prices ( a depreciating US dollar)would be inflationary in many sectors of an economy where businesses rely on imported goods or industrial parts."

But you have to report everything for the wealth tax. Capital lost are also without tax influence. In Germany you have to pay tax on everything and soon also precious metal.

And we will still need oil for long haul trucking,  ocean shipping, airliners, winter heating in most places, and feedstocks.  All these substitution games might delay the day when any one fuel reaches critically short supply that can only be cured by demand destruction, but it also means that oil, gas,  coal, and U235 are likely to peak very close together."

And Communism failed. What we see is a complete lack of vision. We need to stop trying to revive failed systems and invent new ones. The future is simple living. Smaller houses, less &quot;stuff&quot; we don&#39;t need, and less consumerism. And what we get in return is a much better deal: an increase in leisure time. The freedom to do what we want, or simply do nothing at all for a few hours.

Just looking at Ethereum compared to Bitcoin, there are so many reasons to believe that at the BARE minimum they could both co-exist in a future economy, and in the worst case Bitcoin could self implode due to a lack of scalability and operational cost of maintaining the network when compared to Ethereum.

I was planning to return to the US but will wait until your dictators are removed from office. Each morning, I walk to one of the large indoor-outdoor markets in downtown Phnom Penh. Markets like this exist all over the Asian and sub-Asian continent. Life is completely normal, as it has always been. No one is freaking out.  Old women sit down upon the filthy earth, selling their goods at market as always.  Dirty old men are everywhere, some working hard while others loaf around. I have lived in Cambodia for 13 years end on end. Life is as it has always been. No one is dying, no one is sick. You might suggest the Cambodia government is hiding the true state of affairs. I know these people intimately, and have strong ties to business and government.  If there were even a hand full of elder folks dying from this viral hoax, the people of Cambodia would be in a total and complete uproar. First off, everyone would be scared to death, talking about it, and running away and taking cover. This is very nature of the Cambodian people and the Khmer culture. They are very honest and truth people, and their youth are role models for the world.  Everything tells me this is one big global fraud. It is being perpetrated for political and economic reasons, and many good folks have fallen for the trap.  You have given away your freedom, liberty, and independence.. America as it once was is dead and gone.  You now live in a communist nation..  Paradoxically, if you study the Khmer culture, you will see we once made our move to communism, but Communism lost, and we are a free people.  Hun Sen is no dictator or heavy handed maniac. Some of his followers are complete idiots, even killers, but this country just came out of war, famine, and genocide.  Hun Sen led us out of the Khmer Rouge. He turned his back against them and fought for the other side.  He came back and gave liberation to his people.  The place is still a mess after cleaning up the mess the American 52 bombers made, but we&#39;ve been working hard to clean it all up.  This virus hoax is about mind control and population control, plain and simple. I can see this clearly from my Asian overseas perspective. No one knows anything about Cambodia unless they have lived here for an extended period and worked closely with the young people."

We all agree the market has run up far beyond logical price to future FCFE. Is it rigged to zig when most the participants zag? Realize there&#39;s more money in tanking the market at this point than to keep propping it up, deep out of the money puts for example. Perhaps the rise is due to; the dumb money rushing back in, fear of missing out,  the idea the fed is going to prop up the stock market? So the shorts come in but the market keeps going up so the shorts get squeezed causing the market go up further, a classic short squeeze?<br>       AND, as the Fed is providing corporate liquidity companies lever up to fund operations by taking on more debt, as I like to call it, giving more and more companies debt rope to hang themselves with.  As companies ultimately go bankrupt vulture capitalists will rush in and buy company assets free of pension obligations, bank funded of course.   As far as the fed buying stock, that would be against their charter.  How would they justify buying stocks at these levels? To cash out the 20% of wealthiest stock holders who happen to own 80% of all the equities? Adding to the debt Americans will be on the hook for? Then what? The stock market collapses?  If the Fed were to buy all of GE for example for I don&#39;t know, 100 billion,  then goes bankrupt, that&#39;s 100 billion the tax payers are on the hook for in addition to the pension liabilities, another 30 billion? Then the Fed sells off the best assets to friends of the fed? Fair market value? Yea I don&#39;t think so. That would be theft to print money to by real assets.  No. At least above board the Fed charter doesn&#39;t allow that.  But who knows what goes on under the table? <br>       The Fed wants Trump reelected? I don&#39;t think so. But maybe.  But then what happens after the election?  The Fed did shrink their balance sheet recently. The rubber band US stock market has been wound up tight in one direction. Buffet has been on the sidelines. Tax loss selling will begin in the 4th quarter and profit taking will likely create a landslide in Jan 2021. And if gold is about to rally, that means money coming out of stocks. And if the dollar weakens substantially that means foreigners will be pulling money out of the US stock market as well. With Tesla&#39;s and Amazon&#39;s automation set to bankrupt all the autos and retailers, gone are all the associated jobs and pensions. Gone will be all the diesel and auto mechanics, truck drivers, and auto workers.  I&#39;d short the Russell 2000.  It&#39;s hard to believe the equity of these overlevered companies are going to be worth more in the future.  Work from home, 1 million mile batteries, retiring baby boomers, artificial intelligence, I predict the market for cars will decline from 18 million vehicles sold in the US in 2019 to under 9 million in 2029.

The younger generations have been crippled by: stagnant wage growth for over a decade, inflating dollar, exploding house prices, insane tuition fees to get a degree, high rents, general inflation in everyday goods etc - the fact marriages have dropped off a cliff for the millennial generation is a testament to that + having postponing having kids.

The velocity of money was higher.  So far we are not doing the same thing because fed money has to make profit. Treasury money goes to pay people who spend it. However the treasury, with congresses approval, has only spent about as much as was lost last quarter. So far I think deflation is still more likely without another large stimulus.

Type is also believed to be more vulnerable to malaria.  I had two lineal ancestors who died from malaria in the ante-bellum Deep South, although I obviously do not know their blood types.  If you do not protect people with either mandatory lockdowns or mandatory mask wearing, then you are probably going to  overwhelm the hospitals, and that is going to raise the death rate, not just from the frankenvirus, but from people with other ailments who cannot be treated in a timely fashion.  <br><br>Some compromise of individual liberties is necessary during an epidemic, and I thought Americans had accepted this reality during the era of Typhoid Mary, but perhaps we have been safe for so long that we have forgotten how dangerous these events can be.

I agree with you about HCL, but East Asian countries also relied heavily on mask wearing.  Thailand even fined people 500 (dollars or baht?) if caught without a mask on.  Also contact tracing and selective quarantines and tighter restrictions on air travel than we have done.  If we did everything else, I am sure we could skip the lockdowns, or have shorter lockdowns only in severely affected cities.  Instead we are still stuck in wave 1 (while other countries are recovering) after an extended nation wide shutdown of the economy and nothing else. Yes, Chris Martenson has a good site. I was already following him because of my interest in resource depletion.  Mutations: in the long run, less deadly versions of a virus have a survival advantage, but in the short run mutations can occur in either direction.  BTW, my age, sex, and type A blood all put me in a high risk category, but my health is good so I would probably survive it.  What worries me most is that some people suffer lung damage or other organ damage, which may be permanent, and also that I might not be allowed to access HCL in a timely manner if I were to contract this infection.  The manmade origin of this virus is clearly being suppressed by the mainstream media and politicians, probably because they are corrupted by the CCP  to varying degrees through financial favors or blackmail.  There is compelling evidence that the world&#39;s major intelligence agencies have a tremendous amount of hidden influence in world affairs, including influence over what news  the majority of people get to hear or not hear.  WHO and CDC both appear to be doing more harm than good, probably because both are heavily staffed by people chosen for their political loyalties rather than professional competence."

Here goes: how safe then are government treasury bonds? For it is by these that the Australian government is paying for the costs of the pandemic economic shut down.  The Reserve Bank of Australia creates the money, the Government issues treasury bonds to the Reserve Bank in exchange, the Reserve Bank sells the Treasury bonds to investors (big and small, individuals and corporations) and at the maturity date, the government pays them out.  Will the government be able to pay them out on maturity? Or will the cycle have to repeat.  Globally:  At the end of the global crisis will a new world economic system have to be created, such as in the way the Bretton Woods Agreement was created at the end of WW2? If so what will that look like?  How does the world transition to that?"

It is amazing how the banking sector  fought  to be able to charge interest on debt and take away the state&#39;s ability to fund their own debt. The debt system allowed societies to accelerate their growth and propulsion development, at the expense of becoming slaves of the financial system. If all debt in the world is paid off and nobody borrows in the future, the world financial system would collapse, so we need to keep borrowing through the state, private institutions and individuals, and maintain the banking sector in their throne. But hey! this is legal so it must the right way to do things (sarcasm)  Look throughout history how different societies have done wrong to others by making their actions legal."
8264,Can The Fed Go BUST? (Shocking Secrets Revealed!),Guy Willoughby,"Mnuchin said that the tax payer would bail out the Fed. With the manufacturing sector now in China, Mexico etc. so is the tax base. Which means fewer people are being taxed more. With the number of permanent job losses due to the Cervesa sickness means fewer tax payer and higher social support payments the tax base has been reduced even farther. Then there is the federal debt being at historic highs and a bunch of expensive wars around the world. How can an insolvent country bail out an insolvent federal reserve?

8285,Jason Hartman (Real Estate Expert Gives Market Update And Predictions!),Fact Check1984,"Guys over 7 million people died during the Great Depression many starved and more went hungry. Please brush up on history. The comments about the depression not being so bad for many people is wrong. People were greatly impacted by the Great Depression - first thousands of banks closed and people lost savings. Further most employment was not urban but agricultural. The modern technology came in during this time putting many agricultural workers out of a job. There was no credit, so any financed asset fell to the cash purchase value which was a drop of 80-90%. The real cause of the Great Depression was not the stock market crash, that was just the first phase, it was the sovereign debt defaults of European countries in 1931 causing european government bonds held by moms and pops in the US and by US banks to go to zero value causing banks to close their doors due to insolvency and mom and pops got wiped out. This is documented in part in President Herbert Hoover&#39;s memories."
8286,Jason Hartman (Real Estate Expert Gives Market Update And Predictions!),Fact Check1984,"there is some criticism about the 1200 checks but I think they should have sent those out because people are already living paycheck to paycheck and that is not their fault necessarily. If you look at wages they have been stagnant for many years while people took on extra work to pay the  increasing costs of living. If they had not paid the 1200 we would have had civil unrest... people need to eat. The wealth inequality in the country is cause by the banking system giving out huge loans for houses and student loans, deregulating banking, and our currency which is at the end of its lifecycle and needs to be reset. Workers are not to blame for that."

8307,Marxism Is Taking Over The US: Will It Succeed? (Answer Revealed),ErDaddy,"Wow that&#39;s interesting. I honestly never knew that Marx thought that you had to go through capitalism to get to communism. I fully support capitalism and i think we need to protect it at all costs for the foreseeable future, but I&#39;ve always held the notion that some day, very very far in the future, we may need to move to communism, but right now is way too soon. The only reason i think far far in the future, is like when A.I. controls everything and is able to advance technology for us, and when (or if) we get to a point where we have a society like star trek with replicators and there is basically no jobs available for humans anymore. Once we get to the point where literally machines do everything or 95%+ of all work (including technology advancement), then and only then should we move to a communist society. But that is easily 100+ years from now, if not a few hundred. If we switched now, people would have little to no incentive to advance technology or just go do a mundane job. As long as humans are still required to advance technology and create most goods/services, then capitalism is the only way."

These banksters and entrepreneurs made trillions through manufacturing and dumping their cheap products in the West, wiping out capital, all competition, manufacturing, tens of millions of jobs in most of the West, creating trillions in trade deficits,   transforming every leading Western nation from a creditor nation to a debtor nation.  <br><br>If you have any investigative skills and realize we are in a plandemic then you ought to realize we also have been put right smack into a planned &quot;depression&quot;. The deliberate and unnecessary shutting down of the economy has dramatically increased the fear and government dependency.

Without the Great Depression none of the FDR far-left, government-control measures could have occurred. If not engineered it was a learning experience for the banksters controlling the economy.  In our time with the world being much wealthier with food and goods is greater supply than ever before, none of the fear and dependency being manufactured now could have been generated for their desired technocratic, social and financial changes without a planned pandemic as a pretext to shut everything down as much<br>as possible.

Looking at 17th, 18th and 19th century Great Britain the populations were almost wiped out due to disease and pestulance directly related to poverty. To fix this problem large corporations need to be broken up and made to compete. The income of people who make billions serves no one but rather than taxing them break up their companies.

So, if the FED buys other currencies but doesn&#39;t get any real goods and services with it, it&#39;s like buying a gift box without the gift in it, and by the way, on purpose. I think, politically speaking, that wouldn&#39;t fly. That&#39;s where Brent Johnson argues there&#39;s a line imposed by U.S. administration and congress delimitating the power of the Fed in the U.S best interests, even thou it might result in some sort of Plaza Accord between broken countries in the future.

Keep it going.  <br>I keep struggling with everybody’s assumptions that the central bank is watching out for the welfare of the nation AND that it could go broke.  Try the following and let me know what you think: <br>Here is a concept that could liberate one from the sheeple belief that the Fed is trying to save us and the economy.  <br>I’ll ask a few questions that may help one discover the darker side to what is really happening: <br>1.  How much does it cost the Fed to buy up all of those debt and paper financial instruments? <br>2.  If they (or you) could buy up more and more for nothing, what would keep them from buying up EVERYTHING? <br>3.  Haven’t you noticed that the regulations restricting the Fed have been loosened up every time the stock market seems ready to crash?  <br>4.  When the economy and the market finally crashes, how possible will the counterparties be able pay their obligations? <br>5.  If and when they cannot pay(default), doesn’t the “collateral” go to the owner of the debt instruments(ie the Fed)? <br>6.  Who controls the levers to let the markets crash? <br>7. Cui Bono?  (Who benefits at the end of the game?)<br><br>We all at the verge of the largest wealth robbery with the average person cheering the Fed to buy more. Please wake up!!!!!<br><br>In case you can’t answer the questions, the answers are below. <br>1. Nothing <br>2. Nothing<br>3. Yes, (all sorts of new 3-5 letter schemes. )<br>4. Very difficult to impossible <br>5. Yes. Whether it’s the property (from mortagages) or company (from bonds) they are legally transferred over upon default. <br>6. The Fed. <br>7. The Fed."

8371,Dollar Reserve Currency Status END GAME!

And with the SDR interest rate as low as it is today, just 5bp, wouldn’t this allow them to obtain FX reserves? The only other option I see is gold which technically can count as an FX reserve. But Treasury would need to then change the book value of $42.22 to something else in order to dissolve the incumbered gold certificates held by the Fed for all 261million Troy oz."

8377,Dollar Reserve Currency Status END GAME! (Part 2 Conclusion),David Mccartney,"Why can&#39;t the Fed just let their bloated balance sheet run off again, and control the dollar value that way?  Possibly Increasing or decreasing that amount of run off to drive the US dollar the amount higher rather than sell  foreign currency in the FX markets...  And since they don&#39;t have, or need very much foreign currency unless they wish to manipulate that individual  valuation, and since we are still in your example,  the reserve world currency in the world.  I would think a higher less liquid dollar causes the risk of a world reset of the reserve status much more..  And not a weaker more liquid dollar as your example.  .  Would that move in the Fed&#39;s balance sheet run off not  shrink the dollars in the system like happened recently?   You know use the Dollar Milkshake theory that seems to have worked in the currency markets..  Couldn&#39;t that be used  to the Feds control and advantage? .  Unintentionally previously or not,  it might be useful.  Of course it also may effect the stock market confidence in a adverse way as well.  But every strategy effects areas differently.  It&#39;s how well they time their policies that matter.  Just a possible strategy observation that might not have been considered.  I very much enjoy your analysis.  Keep up the great content.

So in the real example, isn&#39;t it not necessarily 0. And with an expense of 500 per month, they have 5.5k to be able to pay back, and potentially save up. But I see what you mean in a sense, even if they could pay back the loan, they would have some kind of funnel that ends with a net debt. Especially with interest rates in that scenario. Def increased income is a solution, easier to see possible for a corp. Thanks, but also if you could address that aspect, greatly appreciated.<br><br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI5z8ezqO_I&amp;t=25m00s"">25:00</a> I&#39;m also a little confused on the part where a J corp pays off their loan, they&#39;re effectively decreasing their deposit right? So you&#39;re saying that the decrease in deposits is the same as decrease in dollars? Is that because the pay back drops the deposit, and the deposit is funny money, and so it doesn&#39;t go into the Bank&#39;s reserves? Why wouldn&#39;t it go there before just disappearing?

Regular Joe trading is just a disaster waiting to happen. It took me 6 years to figure it all out, good entries are the least of it. Money management, position sizing, being extremely disciplined, unemotional, unflinching and comfy with large draw downs - all of these things need to be internalized before a person can trade or &quot;follow the trend&quot; successfully. Making it sound like its easy in this video is just untrue and dangerous. Renko charts are actually more treacherous than candlesticks because you will have to set huge stops and can loose often if all you do is follow Moving Averages cross overs. You need a sophisticated, intelligent strategy to trade, moving averages will not give you that edge. Moving averages can serve as a component but as a strategy can be a disaster. In  lull markets which happens all the time, taking moving average cross overs can mean the end of your trading account. If you are going to suggest people turn to actual trading, do a video on all the pitfalls of a regular trader and how most traders as in 97% loose money trying to trade. If it was easy, everybody would be a millionaire by now, there is a reason why only a few percent succeed.

8448,Patrick Ceresna (Build Your Own DRAGON PORTFOLIO: Commodities Trend Following),Cynthia Watch Wrangler,"This is over-complicating the implementation. Firstly, professional CTAs haven&#39;t made money this decade so what chance do retail DIY stand? The least worst trend ETF is $ROMO, which is trend equity and will do all the work for you. So find room for $ROMO (10%, 20% or whatever) then simply own a small percentage of an energy or miner ETF. This exposes the investor to trend/momentum (tail risk protection), and commodities (inflation protection), and all it requires is occasional re-balancing once a year, no messing about look at moving averages."
8449,Patrick Ceresna (Build Your Own DRAGON PORTFOLIO: Commodities Trend Following),Cynthia Watch Wrangler,"Orpheus Epiphanes So you propose that retail investor trend follow dozens of markets on their own? And for what purpose? They won&#39;t make any money because the CTAs can&#39;t crack it. There are funds which trend follow equity indices, much smarter option. The roll premium has disappeared it&#39;s not the 1980s any more."

On one hand, you praise her as the next big thing, along the likes of Buffett whom you believe will be right about the stock market in the mid-term oppose to the shoe shine kid.  Yet on the other hand, you don&#39;t think we should blindly follow her portfolio because there is a chance the shoe shine kid may know better by doing their own research such as following your advice.  So George, is Lyn the real deal or any average Joe can reach her level?  Obviously not, but yet you suggest that the shoe shine kid should give the market a go rather by using Lyn&#39;s advice rather than investing according to Lyn.  While you ridicule the shoe shine kid for investing into Hertz, at the same time, you promote the idea that &#39;hey, you never know&#39;, Lyn may have missed out on Hertz so don&#39;t follow her portfolio..I think you are trying to play too many roles to cater a wide audience at the expense of not being committed to solid principles."

All the money you save each month you put in the index fund. The trick is never to sell. When there is a stock crash you don&#39;t sell. Don&#39;t panic. You will beat nearly all the active managers/investors in the long term. Truth is I sold all my stocks at the end of February 2020 (no index funds mind you). Now the stocks have almost recovered to the levels before the crash. Bummer.... I did panic. I don&#39;t know what to do now. I am frozen in fear."

8600,Patrick Ceresna (Build Your Own DRAGON PORTFOLIO: How To Go Long Vol),James Dobson,Would you say the same principles apply to a Put Backspread? I’ve noticed the ratios are not the same
8601,Patrick Ceresna (Build Your Own DRAGON PORTFOLIO: How To Go Long Vol),i need more sleep,"after thinking about the call backspread for a bit, i quickly realized you could do a put backspread. Amazing way to put on a short position with no negative carry. Very useful for today&#39;s market, which just trickles higher slightly every day, but may suddenly sell off. <br><br>Then I thought about it some more and realized that you could put both on too and make a weird kind of straddle. The &quot;double backspread&quot;. It would profit greatly from large increases in volatility and gamma. It would lose with small gamma. Patrick said you can roll the contract to avoid this, but would that still work since only one side would be profitable? The other side doesn&#39;t lose, either way. Maybe you only roll that side? And you could roll the other when the price swings the other way. Very interesting. I&#39;ll need to do some research. <br><br>I thought the only other non-calendar strategies were call/put credit and debit spreads, straddles/strangles, and going naked. Really shows that theres always more to learn!"

8611,Patrick Ceresna (Build Your Own DRAGON PORTFOLIO: How To Go Long Vol),fceneviva1,"The trade ideias shared by Patrick are great and useful. But one thing that it’s not clear is how to size it. As an example, allocate roughly 20% to stocks, bonds, gold or even commodities trend following is simppe. You just buy x shares of SPY, TLT, GLD and do an active managment of an commoditiy Etf. But how do i size 20% into a call/puts backspreads portfolio?"
8612,Patrick Ceresna (Build Your Own DRAGON PORTFOLIO: How To Go Long Vol),Harry Speakup,"Hi George, this is a really great series. I&#39;m a complete newbie to options but want to implement the Dragon portfolio as a retail investor in the uk. I knew nothing about options before i watched this. However, I watched very closely and I worked out one glaring omission concerning the backspread strategy that should be highlighted. When the call you sell is in the money, but the calls you buy are out of the money you realise a relatively big loss compared with the negative carry of using a basic option as portfolio hedge. I realise that you should only apply this strategy when the volatility trend is in your favour and that this should minimise or even eliminate this outcome. Also, Patrick did state that you should generally not let the options expire and this would also minimise the risk of an in the money call-sell combined with the two out of the money call-buys, but I think its important to be aware of the explicit downside of any strategy. Another thing that would&#39;ve been nice to include would be how to close out positions early, particularly how to close out a position in an option I&#39;ve sold. I hope this doesn&#39;t sound negative or in any way critical, Patrick is great, the series is great and the rebel capitalist show is also great. I&#39;m a big fan."

I&#39;m saying this to encourage you and Jeff both and mean the best so we can all learn from his big brain.  He is a humble genius imho.  Perhaps a touch of Asperger like so many brilliant folks.<br><br>If you go to his blog, he ALWAYS tangents off on indirect flowery language and it&#39;s a struggle to follow the point he&#39;s making.  Horrible actually.  In his recent chartbook on MV and his own blog, it wasn&#39;t until I saw the two pictures (Powell as Noah&#39;s ark, and then the old man with a fire hose) that I got an inkling of what he was trying to say, but still after going through his readings or MV podcast, he basically doesn&#39;t ever just say what&#39;s happening, or make predictions or say anything actionable.  <br><br>An alternative would be Ray Dalio&#39;s style.  As a communicator and you can tell his effort at directness in his speaking and writing, which is aligns with his direct management style.  <br><br>I wish Jeff would try to use 2 sentences without the word &quot;not&quot; for every sentence that contained the word &quot;not&quot;.  And cut back on unnecessary similes, metaphors, and analogies if they&#39;re not warranted, or use them after AFTER he has directly stated his point which may need clarification."

Right now the market is melting up perhaps due to a short squeeze and fear of missing out, the dumb money rushing in as the party is about to end. The Fed is not allowed to buy equities, they&#39;re talking down corporate borrowing rates and perhaps giving these companies enough debt rope to hang themselves with. Why would the Fed buy stocks when they or their friends can scoop up company assets in bankruptcy court free of pension obligations? With Tesla and Amazon&#39;s automation set to bankrupt all the autos and retailers, gone are all the associated jobs and pensions. Gone will be all the diesel and auto mechanics, truck drivers, and auto workers. 1 million mile batteries? Retiring baby boomers? AI?

Nevertheless, I am still hopeful to hear our fearless leader,  the third wheel to the quad, the 9th member of the group of 7, the “where the bloody hell are ya”, Scomo PM to announce the specifics of JobMaker as follows:<br><br>After avoiding the horror show we have seen overseas, we need to get Australia back to work.  No, life can not be exactly the same as it was pre-COVID.  So, we now need Australians to reskill for a new economy, and yes that will mean investing time and money in a very targeted and effective way, and that (I hope) is what JobMaker will do.  Just as with the health crisis, we will need the help of all Australians to do their bit. We need to make Australia smarter, more creative, more adaptive, and more productive. <br><br>Australia has been the “‘Lucky Country”, we are still the “Lucky Country”, and with good management we will remain the “Lucky Country&quot;. And so we need to harness our boundless energy and natural resources. As Australians, we have developed a tradition of inventing ways to export value added sunlight to the world - whether it be as wool, grain, oil, gas, or coal.  We now need to kick-start our economy with renewed investments into such things as our electricity grid, our hydro/irrigation infrastructure, and a new hydrogen network, to enable the addition of efficient and sustainable energy production. Whether this be in the forms of solar, wind, geothermal, or something else.  We also need to invest in effective methods of storing that energy so that it will be available when we need it, at a price we are willing to pay.<br><br>There is no place I’d rather be right now than Australia.  We are in an enviable position to lead the world out of COVID and kick-starting our industry with new means of productive capacity to orgment our existing capabilities.  Whether it be in the forms of Hydrogen, Sustainable Steel, and even more efficiently produced agricultural products. <br><br>There is only one way back onto our path to prosperity, and that is to reequip ourselves for the economic changes, and put Australia to work."

He is right though to say that bank lending has been inflating existing asset prices without adding new value. Here is where it matters because of the debt burden, particularly on younger people who have become mortgage serfs, i.e., they have sacrificed their ability to be flexible in their life choices because of the fear of losing their jobs and defaulting on their mortgages. It is unsustainable and the covid induced rise in unemployment in this group will create havoc in the housing market."

If debt/gdp is under 100%, say 10%, so debt is 2 trillion and gdp is 20 trillion.  You can increase debt/gdp WITHOUT the private sector shrinking.  EXAMPLE:  Debt goes up by a trillion to 3 trillion and gdp goes up by a trillion to 21 trillion.  The debt to gdp increased but the private sector could still be the same because gdp increased by the amount of additional debt.  BUT if gdp is already at 100%, say 20 trillion and 20 trillion, the debt now must exceed nominal GDP growth in order for the debt to gdp to increase.  If debt goes up faster than nominal growth the private sector must of shrank, if it wouldn&#39;t of shrank nominal growth would be the same or greater than the increase in debt (bc the debt is spending which creates GDP).  There may be some cases where the export/import ratio could change gdp enough to make it mathematically possible, but the overall concepts are the same.  Thx for watching everyone! ;)"

8781,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Scott O'Donnell,Looking for feedback on this idea I have been thinking about as the only reason this could possibly not all end up poorly. If the problem with &quot;printing&quot; money is that it devalues the currency against other currencies but all other central banks and currencies are also &quot;printing&quot; money at a similar rate is it possible to get into this homeostasis level of money printing where we don&#39;t see the blow-up and inflation?<br>Also with massive debt levels all around the world if this &quot;new&quot; money is used mostly to service debts which we know actually removes money from circulation would this not remove some of the inflation risk and allow this to continue for much longer then we think?

8839,"Robert Barnes (Freedom, Gun Rights, Riots/Looting, Having A Plan ""B"") RCS Ep. 58",John P,"&quot;It is highly annoying when I listen to individuals speak from only one perspective.  It&#39;s as if they&#39;ve been successfully propgandized and only see the world with one lens.&quot; It&#39;s quite ironic when someone believes almost everything in the MSM and then makes statements like that. Do you realize more than 15 people have died in the riots, not including mysterious ambushes of cops all over the country (including my area)? And billions of dollars of damage done by the rioters? And Antifa has actually taken over parts of Seattle? And that trying to storm the White House and overthrow law enforcement is part of an insurrection?"

8841,"Robert Barnes (Freedom, Gun Rights, Riots/Looting, Having A Plan ""B"") RCS Ep. 58",T C,"Could Robert Barnes not help some of the young men (law abiding and with no prior criminal records) who have been unjustly jailed for defending themselves from violent attacks by Antifa/BLM thugs? There are now dozens of them, rotting in jail for many years (from 4 to 400+ years each!), when they&#39;ve committed no crime whatsoever. People tried to get them decent lawyers and were unable to because no lawyer wanted to take on such politicized cases; on top of that, every single website and payment processor has immediately deleted the campaigns to collect funds for their legal defense (while crowdfunding for violent criminal Antifa and BLM members is allowed and promoted). Most of these men used no guns in defending themselves (against attackers armed with weapons, flamethrowers, bats, etc) and yet got long prison sentences for simply punching or kicking their attacker, without causing any significant harm (or, in some cases, for firing a warning shot in the air). The poor young man (James Fields) whose car was attacked by a mob of violent Antifas and BLM thugs, incl. by a university professor (!) who is Antifa member and who threatened the driver with a shotgun, got a life sentence + 416 years in a kangaroo court. His &quot;crime&quot; was to try to escape the mob threatening his life, in the process of which his car hit another car in front of him, resulting in the death of a female Antifa member (actually, according to the autopsy she died of heart attack and not from any impact injury). His case (and that of all the others) has been exceedingly well documented due to the copious amount of videos taken by several participants (videos proving these men&#39;s innocence), and yet they have all been convicted, while their attackers remain free to this day. There is NO justice in the &quot;justice&quot; system. If you are white and defend yourself from an attacker, you&#39;re going to jail for a long time. That&#39;s the reality of it. And you&#39;ll be denied the right to get a decent lawyer, being instead forced to use a govt provided one, who will not do anything to defend you."

Her view is it is possible for Gov to deficit spend to increase goods/services therefore GDP with minimal CPI inflation  4. Juliette, like Professor Steve Keen, and Richard Werner are all incredible macro thinkers but not exactly &quot;Austrian&quot; which is why I think we can gain just as much by listening to them as Peter Schiff and Jim Rogers.

8922,Chris Macintosh (Ex Wall St. Insider On Todays Macro Environment) RCS Ep. 56,David Collins,"I like the analogy of expanding the pie vs dividing the pie.  If humans wish to coexist with themselves and other species, then we are going to have to understand that the world is comprised of finite resources.  Of course there are going to be humans that grab a bigger slice, but that slice needs to be earned; not through exploitation or manipulation due to proximity of resources or even skills.  Back in the 60&#39;s, Executive pay to average pay was at 20 times.  Can that be said of any corporation now?.  Sam Walton procreated some children who are now billionaires.  Did those children earn those billions?  Capitalism is the best form of distribution but it can lend itself to self-destruction through exploitation and the accumulation of surplus value.  We are always going to have the rich and powerful but we need less concentration and centralization that leads to authoritarianism as Chris so succinctly state.  End the Fed, reduce executive pay, disseminate estates to divisible buckets.  What would the world be like if Bezos suddenly came to a change of heart and decided to keep 8 billion (cause anyone with means needs at least 100 million/year to live the good life) and bequeath the remainder to his employees (in the form of stock ownership)?"

8932,LIVE STREAM Q&A,Peter Gabriel,"On relocation packages, they often include moving/purchasing compensation. Renting won&#39;t get you 80k but buying will. Often times keeping your house empty is better than renting it out because the company gives you money if you keep it or if you buy where you&#39;re going. Pensions are tricky to fund at your home country so compensate in a way. International moves used to be a standard package but companies are cutting back since 2000."

I have a feeling that you don&#39;t bother to check all the posts in your live streams, especially those very near the end of a long session.    I really hope you see my post in the final couple of minutes, or better yet, read it here:  Crypto Eri is encouraging all of her subscribers to put the word out so as to make the proper people very aware of today&#39;s news / situation.  The U.N. honcho (name onknown,) gave a speech or an interview (not clear) that the entire world is on the precipice of the economic situation, presently dire, such that we urgently need to have a &quot;worldwide reset.&quot;  Only the &quot;dire, urgent&quot; part of this message, announced direct to the public is new, today.  Crypto Eri says to put the word out to all content providers and people in political office, that we DO HAVE XRP at the ready.  There is no way to know whether the U.N. is completely aware of that option.   The U.N. itself is not really the organization to pull the trigger.  The guy doesn&#39;t mention XRP,  but that is nothing new.  I know that you have significant following and you have the ear of important people.   Help make sure that the responsible parties are reminded sufficiently.  ...  Charley"

(Here's How),Alex P,"When government officials willfully refuse to honor their solemn oaths to our Constitution, and victimize and neglect average people, that government has become not only completely illegitimate but an affront to the Constitution itself.  The Founding Fathers foresaw this, and they provided the remedies required.  it&#39;s up to us to utilize those remedies permitted according to law.  It says clearly, We The People are the government.  If we refuse to act, this nation may well fall under tyranny, and that is why the Second Amendment was established. <br><br>One lessonl learned in the midst of the recent widespread civil unrest is the obvious inability of government&#39; to enforce anything.  When sufficient numbers of people simply refuse to comply, their power is gone.  In short, when people acquiesce they go along tacitly and become serfs.  When they do the opposite, and embrace the Golden Rule they achieve freedom."

It is used in China. In the US/EU etc reserves are calculated based on RWA (risk weighted assets * 8%) and CECL standards. They take into account riskiness of the assets. As far as I know, after March Treasuries carry 0 RWA and thus do not require reserves."
9043,Is Your Money Safe? Shocking Answer... (Bank Reserve Secrets Revealed!),Roman Kalinin,"I described regulatory reserves here. Banks also have to calculate another reqs- economic capital, which ensures that they are AA quality. So, yes, two types of reqs. Banks are supposed to post whatever is larger. After GFC regulatory reserves are usually larger. Plus they calculate all other sorts of capital reqs. Asset/liability, operational, market etc. SO, the bottom line, they carry a lot of reserves. Whether they make the banks AA or not is a separate issue. I do not believe this is the case))"

Investment is one of the best ways to achieve financial freedom. For a beginner there are so many challenges you face. It&#39;s hard to know how to get started. Trading the Crypto market has really been a life changer for me. I almost gave up on crypto currency at some point not until I got a proficient trader James Carlson, he gave me all the information required to succeed in trading. I made more profit than I could ever imagine. I&#39;m not here to converse much but to share my testimony; I have made total returns of about 7.6BTC from an investment of just 1BTC. Thanks to JAMES I&#39;m really grateful especially during the lock down. I have been able to make a great returns trading with one of the best platforms around. I discovered I made more income than what my current job pays. I urge anyone interested in Cryptocurrency to take bold step by giving the Bitcoin market a trial if you really want to make more money.

If you have bullion (which is CGT free) do you think there could be a small window of opportunity to convert high priced metals to crashed properties before such a tax came in?  I know that trying to second guess governments is almost impossible, but do you not think that if they launch such a Gold windfall tax it would reveal to the public that their paper money is trash, or am I giving too much credit to the 95% for their ability to suss out this ponzi scheme, even at that stage?

9151,Danielle DiMartino Booth Reveals Incredible Insights For 2020! RCS Ep. 52,Petkus Cinta,Australia is managing well because Australia managed to get into surplus status just before covid-19 (cashflow wise) hence it has basket for helping businesses and people not to go under. <br>Buying time to avoid bloodbath and when lifting support hoping for knife or paper cut instead. The truth is 2 - 4 months away
9152,Danielle DiMartino Booth Reveals Incredible Insights For 2020! RCS Ep. 52,Petkus Cinta,Well what you saying Danielle is that basically Powell and feds central bank are failing to execute what Ray Dalio describes us “BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING” where speed of printing money should be slightly higher than disappearing credit+revenue. The problem is I can’t see credit disappearing.<br>Proper way is to enter austerity+redistribution of wealth+credit cuts/reduction (deflationary) combined with printing money while credit disappearing. In ratio there is no inflation. Instead we adding credit on the scale big time while printing money. Still no inflation but the scales are structurally tested under the weight of credit and printed money 💰

RCS Ep. 52,Petkus Cinta,"Maybe they think this is virus caused so let’s try to increase credit and print money first and maybe we recover and only then win will do deleveraging standard way  = less total damage.<br>Finally, I wonder if they do it to show capitalism works for November account or to show it does not. I think first. If Trump is re-elected already you would see Stockmarket crashing a deleveraging  normal way (not MMT way)."

An estimated in 2030 1 in 2.<br>Now you should look at the multi-billion hotel industry and ask yourself, those owners of these 100 years old corporations that on weekend have a party with the presidents will allow some nobody slave on the loan to mess with their business while avoiding taxes and get away with it? Childish even to disguise about tit.  But now the question. Why Airbnb was allowed in the first place?<br>It was to put in debt millions of people worldwide, keep prices up in every major city.  What could be the amount of debt that a single internet webshop created that cost 10 dollars to open? A trillion? More? have no clue but in paid backs should be definitely around. Now hope is clear how someone with the air mattress becomes: &quot;billionaires&quot; overnight. getting a monthly check of 10000 dollars at max, and probably in dept as well.  :)<br>So what&#39;s coming in the near future like 2030-2040<br>Real estate is worthless. the landlord will tell you to have it free just pay community bills and live how long you wish, but you will say thank you there is several empty condominiums in manhattan 0.05-0.1 bitcoin per month all included. But then you will change your mind and buy a mansion for 10 bitcoins...... This is the near future the greatest great reset. <br>There is a huge decline in populations already going throughout the years.

For me personally it may just be a world view that believes chaos is a likelier bet than control.  I generally believe that we as a species and society and culture are falling ass backwards into things and stumbling forward without plan or direction.  It is more of an organic exploration of the outer bounds of what we know than a planned conspiracy or racket or plan.  Of course, I am not going to deny that great points can be made in the control camp."
9243,"Emil Kalinowski (Host of ""Making Sense/Eurodollar University"") RCS Ep. 50",Dave Shiroma,"If cognitive dissonance exists at the highest levels, then it trickles all they way down. Ultimately there is no way for us to escape the “Keynesian” trajectory because human nature will always trust false “C” over the hive mind natural intelligence of the free market. Really this is a reflection of human nature and our tendency to believe we’re smarter individually than the market and our ability to allow our personal fears to be soothed by controlling behaviors (even if we proxy that to “politicians”) which we compound by rationalizing it away through various methods. There’s also something to be said for need to focus on problems outside of ourselves to satisfy our own inherent lack of control of our own lives. Maybe this is what separates man from animal. We’re so worried about survival that we create complex systems in an attempt to control things we have not control over. Conversely, animals just worry about themselves and their offspring. Then again, maybe it’s just our ability to project into the future. Even though that’s an illusion in and of itself."

Here&#39;s a question; what is meant by the word &quot;they&quot;?  If, as I see it, central banks are institutions through which persons transit then the &quot;they&quot; of central banking is time variant; this quarter&#39;s &quot;they&quot; is not quite last quarter&#39;s &quot;they&quot; and its definitely not last crisis&#39;s &quot;they&quot;.  And if individual incentives have anything to say, as I presume they do, then predictions of central bank action must account for the fact that the personal cost/benefit calculation for any central banker at any given moment is sufficiently biased in the direction of the status quo. Therefore neither incompetence nor conspiracy are necessary to predict the actions of central banks; rational self-interest is all that&#39;s necessary."
9252,"Emil Kalinowski (Host of ""Making Sense/Eurodollar University"") RCS Ep. 50",Emil Kalinowski,"Hey Tim.  I like to think of central bankers as &quot;they&quot; because it is a representation of mainstream, credentialed economics.  The top schools, the professors, the most famous names, the technocrats, et al. represent the same policies.  That&#39;s why you can substitute the managers and executives from time to time over the past decade or two and produce the same results."

Banks are just agents/subsidiaries of the central banks to check creditworthy.<br><br>This would also eliminate plenty of risk from banks holding and selling derivates to each other.  On the other hand central banks can secure the banking sector when there is a threshold of the negative FED funds rate under which no negative interest is paid.<br><br>Personally, I believe that banks will disappear in  10, 20 or 30 years.

9355,Jason Hartman: Expert Real Estate Investor Gives Market Update! RCS Ep. 48,Matt,"Jason Hartman, sorry but you are SO WRONG!! I am a retired 20+ year mortgage banking professional and this is what I feel after uncomfortably watching your pitch to sell properties on your website during this pandemic with a man I respect (George) who also sat silent on the below issues:<br><br><br>#1: How will anyone do well in real estate now whether or not their property is under 250k?? You didn&#39;t mention (and neither did you, George) that tenants in the USA NOW DON&#39;T HAVE TO MAKE RENT PAYMENTS regardless of the value of the home they are living in!?!? WHY did you not mention this critical piece of trending data Jason? George? You (George) always give &quot;the inside baseball&quot; on the situation which you are showcasing in any video you do but in this case you never brought it up? NOT ONCE???This goes against everything you&#39;ve always said about &quot;having investments that pay dividends&quot; and to speculate on things like silver for example that don&#39;t pay dividends with a much SMALLER percentage of your investment portfolio. A 250k HOME is a large part of most anyone&#39;s portfolio and NOW it is paying FAR LESS than bullion sitting in a safe. The difference is now in the meanwhile, unlike precious metals, the landlord STILL has to pay property taxes throughout the tenants payment delinquency as well as property insurance and in some cases even HOA Fees!! To ignore all that is like watching CNN. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m writing this on your channel George, I am your biggest fan. And in this video, you let everyone down.  <br><br><br>I know that you and Jason BOTH understand everything I wrote above - but you didn&#39;t include it in Jason&#39;s pitch for his &quot;still viable 250k properties on his website???&quot; This smells foul to me for the first time within any of your videos I&#39;ve ever seen. You are always the guy George who gives us such great insight, you always have &quot;the word on the street&quot; all laid out for us, like your great video of GLD Vs Physical gold ownership and HSBC&#39;s risk in that equation. What a great video. Then there is this one? The 800 pound elephant isn&#39;t paying rent and the law backs this trend now and NEITHER of you talk about it? There is so much more to illustrate in my critique about this video, but the above is long enough. I think to save face you should have Jason back on, and you guys should address what I wrote above. A few of my friends are feeling the same way I&#39;ve written and it&#39;s not going to keep me recommending and believing you if this is the next trend of pandemic investing on this channel."

Isn&#39;t this only true as long as the value of your equity remains in tact?  Then your debt to income ratio works.  But what if your occupancy levels in your apartments drop below your break even point, your investment home values plummet or your stock falls in value; then you are upside down, and even though you can depreciate; the net is your bleeding money.

9382,Billionaire Secrets YOU Can Use To Pay LESS TAX! (Revealed),vvowah,"Backdoor Roth: Don&#39;t ever pay tax on Earned Income, Investing Gains, or on Withdrawal!<br><br>Step 1. Max out your company match and if possible max out your 401K tax-deductible contribution ( I was even putting in after-tax contribution in my 401K, because I was in a good situation). No tax on these earned income dollars, and the matching is free money.<br>Step 2. Retire early and rollover the 401K to a rollover IRA. Your IRA investing gains will earn tax free <br>Step 3. For the next 10-20 years, live a modest lifestyle, work a little, and convert $30K/year from IRA to Roth. The exact amount depends on your filing status (Single vs Married-Jointly), and other income sources. After 20 years, that&#39;s 600k converted; most if not all your money in the IRA should be in your Roth. <br>Step 4. Withdrawal from your Roth is tax free. I&#39;m sure income tax will be higher in 20 years than it is today. <br><br>Other benefits, Roth has no Minimum Required Distribution. And your heirs will not get an estate tax. <br><br>See <a href=""https://www.madfientist.com/"">https://www.madfientist.com</a> he&#39;s got great articles about Backdoor Roth."
9383,Billionaire Secrets YOU Can Use To Pay LESS TAX! (Revealed),vvowah,"Other ways I used to stop paying tax as an average joe. Hope this helps somebody.<br><br>1. I asked my company to re-locate my job/change job title from Silicon Valley to Europe<br>  A. Stopped paying CA State TAX, because I moved to Texas (an income-tax free state) before going to Europe. If you file an address change, and write rent checks to your relative in another state, that proves you moved there, right? Maybe visit a dentist at the new state, or get a gym membership, definitely a new state ID.... <br>  B. All PER DIEM is TAX FREE to Federal for first year (lodging, transport, food). <br>  C. I still had a Bay Area salary in a place that had a way lower cost of living. At the same time, the place had high hotel rates which boosted the per diem rates.<br>  D. Federal&#39;s FOREIGN EARNED INCOME deduction of $90k/year for every year.<br><br>Math: Salary Before Job Change: 100K salary minus CA tax and Fed Tax = 60K Take home<br>Salary First year:  100K + 100K per diem; no state tax (Texas baby!) and no Fed Tax (90k For. Earn income deduction) = 200K Take home<br>Salary 2nd and Beyond: 100K + 100K minus tax on per diem = 170K Take Home<br><br>Most job moves, you WON&quot;T get the per diem so sweet. I was in defense and good ol&#39; Uncle Sam covered my per diem and kept any I did not use. Eventually they started to tighten that.

Please stop telling people this story without telling them the FULL story!!! So for example, after 30 yrs of depreciation, you would have depreciated the value of the property to zero, assuming the property value remain the same at 5 mil, and you SOLD it at 5 mil, you will generate an income of 5 million.<br>In conclusion, you are just deferring being taxed but when you sell the property, Uncle Sam will get back what you have owe him after 30 yrs!"

9402,Chris Irons: Rock Star Host Of The QTR Podcast! RCS Ep. 47 (Explicit),Andrew Vektor,"Love your channel George. I do take some issue with what was said about Bitcoin. You and your guests should always try and clearly distinguish between blockchain technology and Bitcoin to prevent confusing any viewers that may not be aware of the difference. Technically, I agree with most of what you both said on the topic of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is something I would consider a speculative investment, but no more so than stocks. However, Blockchain technology is here to stay and may really revolutionize the financal industry in ways not many people fully realize yet. Stocks as you know them today may  be replaced with cryptographic tokens one day in the not so distant future. Imagine if you will, trading stocks as easily as transferring Bitcoin. Without any central authority to get in the way or manipulate the rules of the game. Isn&#39;t that the whole point of a capitialist system? As someone who has always hated economics, markets, and finance let me just say that Bitcoin has value to the financial industry as a whole in that it brought software developers like myself into the game. Also, to counter your guests point, I would argue that blockchains do not &#39;need&#39; anymore power than what&#39;s currently required for our national financial systems. They are both after all nothing more than complex mathematical constructs that represent a form of asset ownership. One of them however is far less secure than the other and thus far more likely to be hacked or manipulated by bad actors. We can use blockchains to create a better, fairer, more secure financial system that&#39;s both more transparent and more private simultaneously. Bitcoin started a sorely needed revolution in the financial industry, but Bitcoin is only one small peice of that revolution. I think you both should look more into what blockchain technology is and how it works. It would be awesome if you would then make some new informative videos specifically on how to analyze those markets for people like myself who are new to investing but whose portfolio is 50/50 between stocks and cryptokens. I bet you could increase your YouTube viewship 10 fold by doing some interviews with some of the well known leaders in blockchain finance tech such as Vitalik Buterin, the creator behind the Ethereum blockchain."

9419,"YOUR Investing Blueprint For Inflation, Deflation, Or Recession",G H,"It seems that any portfolio based on past modeling is assuming that things will be similar.  AI and globalization (with the US competing to be the dominant economy) seem like two huge factors that we haven&#39;t had in the past and thus can&#39;t be modeled.  The biggest takeaway I got from the Artemis article is the power of being long volatility (strategically) is probably the best addition one can make based on current known risk factors.  That is where I think most people&#39;s research would be time well spent.  Until proven otherwise, the equity market is the best game in town and by adding long volatility you can continue to play the game and when the inevitable &quot;crash&quot; comes you can use the long volatility asset to keep your portfolio intact and then examine the new investing landscape that emerges and go from there."

9423,"YOUR Investing Blueprint For Inflation, Deflation, Or Recession",Bleeding- Edge,"Hey guys, i found a great article who&#39;s author tries to develop a comparable strategy for Retail investors...for the long volititly trade, i like the TAIL ETF which uses out of the money put options to offset risk instead of a Vix ETF which has negative carry and dilutes your funds fast when markets stabilize...today was a great example....the Dow finished up 900 points 3.85% and S&amp;P500 was up 3.15%, but TAILS was only down  2.6%...so if you have a smaller percentage allocated to TAILS you can still use it as a good HEDGE for downside risk...it won&#39;t protect you 100%, but atleast you will soften the blow with regards to losses........it performed pretty well when stocks tanked in March..it looks like it&#39;s actively managed and when volatility wanes, they reduce their options purchases..it&#39;s only got a 0.59% expense ratio which looks to me to be in the midrange which is good...hope this helps<br><br><br><a href=""https://taylorpearson.me/thedragon/"">https://taylorpearson.me/thedragon/</a><br><br><br><a href=""https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/staying-ahead-tail-risk-etf?nopaging=1"">https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/staying-ahead-tail-risk-etf?nopaging=1</a>"

9480,Hugh Hendry (Legendary Hedge Fund Manager/Macro Thinker) RCS Ep. 46!,CMW,"I&#39;ve hated the fed for pumping up asset prices longer than they needed to too but Hugh makes a lot of good points. QE1 and Tarp were the right thing to do but after that initial shock the markets should have been made to take the hit and rebalance on their own. Low interest rates aren&#39;t just down to the fed though so they deserve some credit. If there&#39;s not enough business growth then how can you meet the demands of those pensioners expecting 5% for doing nothing for 30 years? The fed can&#39;t just magically increase growth to match the rates it would like but the state could do more. It&#39;s Neo-Liberalism, the deregulation of banking and the ignoring of all fiscal policy and relying totally on the central banks to both create jobs, that is the new ideology that is past its usefulness, like the gold standard. It created the inequality and cantillon effects that provokes the anger and populism of today. What the central banks fail to get that has changed is that reducing interest rates in a world of inequality where nobody can afford a house anymore no longer produces a &#39;wealth effect&#39; and in fact makes ordinary people feel poorer so they retrench and spend less so the central banks try to stimulate more and because they can only interact with asset markets that hands more to the asset rich making everyone else feel even poorer and velocity of money drops as it sits in the accounts of those with too much already. We&#39;re at the part of the cycle where we need more Henry Fords again."

Thank you in advance
9503,"How Mysterious ""Dragon Portfolio"" Can Save YOU From Next Collapse!",Aaron Bertoni,"From my understanding of Cole&#39;s paper, the Dragon Portfolio does not outperform stocks in nominal terms, but rather in risk-adjusted terms. In other words, each of his 5 asset classes must be  leveraged to achieve a 15% volatility, or beta. This makes the average Joe investor&#39;s task even more difficult. It&#39;s difficult to get meaningful leveraged positions that control for a targeted volatility. The higher the leverage you pile into each of his 5 asset classes, the higher the long term alpha gain, but you also have to accept a wider volatility. His paper standardized all asset class performances to a 15% volatility risk adjustment. I see a lot of conversation on this Dragon portfolio, but I don&#39;t see nearly enough discussion regarding this technically challenging element. Am I misunderstanding the &quot;Allegory of H&amp;S&quot; paper? George, this wasn&#39;t really touched on in your presentation but the paper makes it pretty clear that his entire theory requires leverage to achieve a volatility target in order to outperform the stock market alone. The Dragon Portfolio is meant for long term pensions in the custody of an advanced management team."
9504,"How Mysterious ""Dragon Portfolio"" Can Save YOU From Next Collapse!",Joelusername,"Been looking for someone to raise this point.  I also think the 15% is investor specific, eg, a mature pension scheme doesn&#39;t want to leverage up to create this sort of volatility but a foundation with a permanent endowment might have a higher tolerance of volatility.  NB volatility is a problematic issue itself as none of us mind upwards volatility (it is the downwards moves we don&#39;t like) but upwards volatility increases risk in most of the measures used by investors."

9539,What Robert Kiyosaki Wants YOU To Know About Investing! (Revealed),xta551,"Friends, I am failing to understand that point. I don&#39;t see why we should prefer having our cash in T-bills rather than in our bank account (checking account, &quot;not invested&quot;), it&#39;s less liquid because I have to wait until the bond gets mature to be able to reuse that money if I am not mistaken. I get the point of getting myself covered in the case of a bank collapse, but do the probabilities of that event make up the loss in liquidity of a T-Bill, also considering the near zero returns of a T-Bill (in some countries they are even negative)?<br><br><br>I also understand that, even if you want to do that you should keep an amount of cash in a bank account just in order to attend your cash flow needs (i.e. Bills) and that amount would be enough to cover you for several months.<br><br>Another question for you guys, do you consider that buying bills from different countries would be a good way to protect against currency devaluation? i.e. I live in the US and buy a Bill from a Euro country. <br><br><br>Just a total noob on this game, bear with me :)"

Sorry Jim (with all due respect), but... in social democratic or social justice terms(including the economic aspect), the US (the so-called land of the free) compared to the EU or the UK, is tantamount to Russia compared to say...Japan, New Zealand, or similar. &quot;The land of the free&quot;  naming was a nationalist exaggeration in the 20th century and it has become a ridiculed label from the start of the current one.

9606,Jim Rogers Helps Decode Inflation vs. Deflation!,David Carey,"Respectfully, I think this video is wrong. Inflation can basically be understood by the amount of money in circulation (most commonly measured by M3) relative to the volume of goods produced in the economy. The cotton example in this video relates to the supply going down in the civil war rather than the money supply going up. This was similarly the case throughout the 19th century when the value of goods produced went up massively relative to the money supply due to the industrial revolution. M3 in the US is currently estimated to be growing at approximately 20% per annum (shadow stats). I don&#39;t expect a massive increase in the volume of goods produced in the US economy, so high inflation is soon coming, particularly once the oil market rebalances."
9607,Jim Rogers Helps Decode Inflation vs. Deflation!,Steve Thedford,"The argument sounds good.   However with the current situation.   Most people are not working and the money given to the people is for survival not for pleasure.  This is not inflationary as people don&#39;t have additional money to drive up prices.   If jobs were available,  people would go back to work. This is the first time in history that I&#39;ve actually seen the government give the people money. The only thing worse than people without jobs is people without food.  Politicians know this and will not allow the people to be hungry.  If they were stupid enough to let this happen,  they would surely meet their maker."

9619,Remaining Super Chat Questions From 5/3/20 LIVE STREAM (Answered),Paul Rey,"Hi George, all the best to You. I slightly disagee with the opinion that if FED gives money to a bank it stays there and doesn&#39;t have effect on the real market (prices of living expenses for people). <br>Example:<br>I want to buy a house. Somebody else (Peter) wants to buy a house as well. If Peter buys a house, his action increases my house price as well. Both would have to get a loan from a bank.<br><br>Compare two scenarios:<br><br>1. With the FED: In case that Peter for whatever reason doesn&#39;t pay his loan back to a bank, FED gives currency to a bank (bailout of some sort). So bank has no reason to change anything. I have to pay that higher house price (because Peter bought his house).<br><br>2. Without FED: In case that Peter for whatever reason doesn&#39;t pay his loan back to a bank, Bank does not get any bailout from FED and would go bankrupt. Bank knows that and for that reason does not give loan to somebody who is clearly insolvent, bank puts regulations in place and Peter does not get the loan. I pay normal (lower) house price (because Peter did not bought his house and that action did not increased my house price).<br><br>As You can see even if FED gives money to a bank only - it has effect on me (I pay higher prices, there are more money in circulation)."

Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 43!,George Gammon,NOTE:  When Marin says positive and negative swap lines he&#39;s referring to countries that DO have swap lines (positive) and countries that DO NOT have swap lines (negative).

9657,Marin Katusa (Resources Expert) REVEALS NEW RISKS! Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 43!,David Carr,Decent analysis but isn&#39;t this just more dollar milkshake theory? It all centers around USD hegemony and things getting &quot;much worse&quot; than they already are for EM&#39;s. Marin is making a huge assumption that the DXY perpetually holds value. But this analysis changes if unforeseen events happen and the DXY instead goes DOWN.
9658,Marin Katusa (Resources Expert) REVEALS NEW RISKS! Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 43!,Liberty Springs,I&#39;ve always done that. It&#39;s strange to me when companies go to risky countries that may not be on the U.S. side in case of war. Even with all the companies building factories in China just for other products. Why risk possible nationalization of your factory by a foreign govt? Weird. China wins by getting all the companies to build factories there for the cheap labor. They took advantage of greed as a foreign weakness and eventually may be able to say ha ha check mate once they have chip manufacturing too when they take Taiwan.<br>I recommend owning physical gold and silver maybe 10% of your wealth but I wouldnt do that without first paying off mortgage and car debt etc. Once debt-free then invest.

Polyus is a Russian company with most of his mines in Russia. I would even think that this negative swap line could be an advantage to them.

9721,Stimulus Checks: Economic Salvation Or Economic Slavery? (Peter Schiff Reacts!),Tiger Fang,This is so wrong and tin foil. You are missing the fact that reshoring is happening through tech. ie production will come back but jobs won&#39;t.  So there still needs to be demand and social stability. UBI is the way to go and automation investment. The internet is automation. YOUR youtube channel is automation and scales infinitely with almost no additional marginal cost.
9722,Stimulus Checks: Economic Salvation Or Economic Slavery? (Peter Schiff Reacts!),Tiger Fang,What you are missing is things are deflationary because of techonology. They need to prop up the demand side with liqudity. Also automation is exponential so 1000x productivity with fewer people.

Helicopter Money/ Universal Pay do not work and only = inflation. The poor remain poor. For example of this: check out the mining towns of Port Hedland and Karratha, Pilbara WA, Australia from 2008 to 2013. The major mining companies provide extra money for rental assistance. As soon as the Real Estate hear of this they jump rentals to match. Hence, it doesn’t work and people are never any better off. As for forcing prices. Recent changes to rental laws in Australia has left thousands of houses vacant and even more Landlords scrambling to get out of their contracts if they can. The lower income side of the community are the ones that suffer from these policies every time. Small Gov and free markets solve these issues."

9772,Peter Schiff: Is He Right Or Wrong About INFLATION?,D Collins,"@coastShooterKills The key is to use debt to buy an assets like the Rental Property where SOMEONE ELSE is paying it off or any type of CASH FLOWING investment. The cash flow from the investment will pay down the debt while you enjoy your life. In other word, Debt for Investment NOT Personal Debt like Student Loans or a Mortgage on where you live."
9773,Peter Schiff: Is He Right Or Wrong About INFLATION?,coastShooterKills,@D Collins so even though the inflation is a get out of jail free card for student loans and mortgages ect they still wont be able to pay it because they will have no jobs to even earn that hyper inflated money? and will still end up defaulting on their loans?
9774,Peter Schiff: Is He Right Or Wrong About INFLATION?,D Collins,"@coastShooterKills Unfortunately, people don&#39;t learn from history. Just look, real estate prices overall Today is where it was before the 2007 bubble popped and people today are saying that &quot;this time its different&quot;. The Stock Market is way worse: 3 times higher than 2007 and some of these analyst say it not a bubble.  IF it was a bubble then, what is called now? It gets better; where as in 07 Americans have some savings and the job market was better, now Americans are buried in Debt (Mortgage, Credit Cards, Student Loans, Car Loan, Personal Loans) and thanks to the Lockdowns, no JOBS. <br><br>Regarding the Banks letting this happen, the Banks just recently (after March this year when the lockdown started) stated to tighten lending standards. All the years before, there was no problem getting a loan, provided that you had a source of income. More debt + More Lending = Higher Markets, until the piper must be paid.<br><br>With Low interest rates and Real Estate, the Sellers benefit because, as the rates get lower (Curtesy of the FED), the price of the house increases (inflation). SO they get to Sell and lock in maximum profits. For the Buyers, they see this as an opportunity because low interest rates also means a lower monthly mortgage payment. You will have more payments, sure, but a lower amount each month, and this is what the buyer mainly look at. Its a mistake, but this is how this Housing Bubble is sustained. <br><br>As to what Peter mention with inflation benefiting the Debtor and not the creditor, I will give you the real estate strategy that George Gammon loves.  Lets say your able to find a good Rental Unit, in a Linear Market, and good Paying Tenants. If you secure the property using debt, specifically a 30yr FIXED rate mortgage, then you are doing a good thing. The reason is because 1) the Mortgage or Loan is Fixed so the banks cannot adjust the interest to meet inflation whenever they want,  and 2) Inflation will wipeout the Debt because the value of the Dollar is in freefall so you are paying back the debt with dollars that have no value or will buy less and less.  Think about it; you take out a loan  and you have to pay back a specific amount 30 years later. We all know that 30 years from now, the dollar is going to buy a fraction of what it could today, thanks to inflation. Its the Same Dollar bills but value is gone. SO who benefits the most in that transaction? The one who is lent the money upfront and uses the dollar when it is still somewhat strong or the one who will get back the dollars years down the line that wont buy anything? In this, Inflation actually benefits the Debtor because it wipes out the value of the debt (ONLY if the loan is a FIXED Rate).<br><br>With Mike Maloney&#39;s &quot;Inflationary Deflation&quot; there actually a better or more well know word for it called Stagflation. I also belief, and Schiff too, that we might see this. Basically, you have Inflation killing the value of the Dollars and as a result, your cost of living increases. However, at the same time, we have a the markets crashing instead of going up because companies aren&#39;t profitable, too much debt to be paid, people cant pay their rent, and a bad job market. So cost of living skyrocketing, while your saving, investment and 401k is getting decimated. Real struggles. This happened in the 1980s."
9775,Peter Schiff: Is He Right Or Wrong About INFLATION?,coastShooterKills,"@D Collins Thanks, my only concern about what peter schiff is saying which i am convinced he is over all right about how eventually it will happen.. i also just dont believe that the same people who are getting sucked into the real estate bubble in the USA with these low interest mortgages and whatever else that they will end up somewhat benefiting from this? because like peter says it will benefit the debtors and not the creditors, there is something in me that says the banks wont let that happen? its just not how the real world works i feel, other then the deflation into inflation possibility that also gets talked about by Mike Maloney (i think his name is) can, or, is there a way “inflationary deflation” can actually hurt the debtors? (its hard to ask this question typing but i hope u understand what im saying)"

9788,Peter Schiff: Is He Right Or Wrong About INFLATION?,Roland Braun,Excellent podcast which can be simply summarized by stating that Fed money printing will temporarily protect the economy from a deflationary doom cycle via increasing consumer prices and the lower supply of goods will force producers to raise prices of their goods to meet the higher fixed costs of production that have to be paid for them to stay in business(scale of economies).

You just have to include that as part of your risk when investing in crypto. The guys who created Tether(USDT) which is a stablecoin that is supposed to represent the US dollar. By right, all the tether that is flowing the market should have a 1 to 1 deposit in the vaults held by tether. But these guys unfortunately are not audited, so they could if they want &quot;print&quot; stablecoins to buy bitcoins/crypto.

This was my personal experience so imagine how many others have had the same experience, I’m a little younger(later gen x), so if I had more ‘on the cusp’ baby boomer/early gen x friends, I can imagine more friends out of work. And the one who got rehired after 10 years, was a younger (no grey)looking man. White hair and too much salt and pepper hair made a huge difference, regardless of experience.

The problem is that so many companies are so short sighted because of the way we do executive compensation and quarterly reports. The current CEO&#39;s will probably just kick the can down the road until their stock drops because they haven&#39;t actually reinvested anything into making the company more capable of generating profits, but they will get out right after they have inflated the stock price, and make a ton of money, screwing over the company, its employees, and other stock holders.

And to answer your question about the halvening most mining firms are leveraged in crypto.  As whales suppress the price they take the risk of riding the shorts down when mining firms go out of business over the next couple of months.  Historically, after 1-2 months there is a slow rise for when the bull market returns.  Prices should begin peaking in around 12-18 months."

Sometimes shutin can result in lower production when pumping resumes (in comes a workover rig) . The reason oil production continues in the bakken even at prices lower than cost of production (45-50/bbl) is due to excess debt. If a company must free up capital to service debt, some companies will produce at a loss to seem solvent. This is indeed a short term solution that will damage the company"

9942,Martin North (Expert Financial Analyst) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 39!,Pete G,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3thero3El1I&amp;t=49m47s"">49:47</a> With regards to a debt jubilee, your hesitation to have one, and the historical aspects that Martin mentioned citing the research of Michael Hudson it is noteworthy that in the texts of the major Abrahamic religions -The Bible, Torah, Quran debt jubilees are mentioned after &quot;7 periods of 7&quot; in an interest bearing money system whereby all debts were to be wiped out and started over. They understood way back then something we have forgotten and that is exponential money systems have a lifespan - typically get maxed out at 49 years. Which brings me to the interesting date of 15 August 2020 which will be the 49th anniversary of when Nixon ended the convertibility of US dollars to gold."

9950,Martin North (Expert Financial Analyst) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 39!,Jay D,"George, you said that in a proper cap system there is the little guy (ex plumber) and the large corp, each with their separate market advantages - you are describing the 1st phase of Capitalism, but the free market nature is that the little guy will ALMOST ALWAYS eventually be consumed by the larger.  Also, that the corps get unfair advantages from Gov&#39;mt (taxes, etc) is not fair - this interaction as well as neo-liberal inter-town, -state, -national corps with no allegiance to a community IS part of the later phases of Capitalism, not a perverted rule-breaking. Marx explained this clearly (no I&#39;m not a Marxist).  I wish it wasn&#39;t true as I own a small business. There has never been a Capitalist nation success story when given enough time to play out.  I invite the audience to name one.  And we wont get into the discussion of its need for imperialism, slavery/oppression/theft, and growing consumer debt to remotely appear as an advantage to the commoner.

Imaging a &quot;Rebel Capitalist Show&quot; featuring several economists, each guest from a different country with George the host. The show tackles the issues the guy on Main St is dealing with and possibly explores alternative solutions. As an example, I enjoyed the discussion on Real Estate, UBI&#39;s and the Cash Ban, tackling issues like these in an open collaborative format I would watch all day long.

9970,Debt Jubilee! Economic Nirvana Or Economic NIGHTMARE? (Revealed),RAY LEFEBVRE,"A Debt Jubilee is a great idea. Sure inflate it away however all the people need to get their slates clean. The trick is to do it openly and equally fair to all individuals rich or poor. To also make this happen bring back Bankruptcy But set up a committee to change the rules so going Bankrupt is fair to all with no credit report stigma attached . Credit ratings must not be harmed at worst the credit rating of the individual or entity must not be harmed. At the same time along with a complete change of Bankruptcy rules with no real penalty or notification on a report is a critical requirement. The last bottom line is to eliminate compound interest for ever and make sure the new rules along with  the Jubilee pay outs is to be sure everyone is treated fairly as they exist in their present condition at the time of the reset or Jubilee, equality and transparency is key critical . Then a new money needs to come into existence which is not totally Fiat but has a real backing like Gold and Silver. In conclusion I see the Debt Jubilee the only way out for the world and all countries must get on board and participate in the world Jubilee. Allow each Country to amend the primary rules of the Jubilee uniquely for that country as long as the end result remains the same as the planners suggested. This new Bail out, Jubilee requires new and fair rules for Bankruptcy or a consumer proposal and add to that the fact this new Jubilee act or legal proposal must be adopted in Principal by every Country  and allowing the act of Jubilee to be a living document meaning it can be amended and changed over time as we evolve but  the  concept of a no fault Bankruptcy when necessary  with conditions etc, be in the act and all nations accept the principal of an occasional Jubilee from debt either when the Government requires it or an individual or corporation goes Bankrupt.  Fairness and equality is critical for this concept to work. You also need a social security net in the system for the very poor in any country for basic human survival needs, as for Millionaires with over 10 million in cash or equity and Billionaires, they need to be cut down in size . No one needs a Billion dollars for themselves. We also want to be fair and allow rich people to remain rich, just not so rich that a few hundred billionaires run the wealth of the world. There is no need for that.  The overall plan is however good if these issues along with protection for retired, pensioners and the disabled  are taken into consideration as well. Capitalism is good and we need it to motivate people but we also need to help people live a free life without a debt albatross hanging around them causing them to suicide, give up or worse. The Jubile must be done fairly and equally for all with each person following the set of Jubilee act laws created along with the new Bankruptcy laws which will be a living document  and the elimination of overly harmful credit scores that literally destroy people and jail them for 7 to 10 years must end. Ratings are still good as long as they are not used to punish people as is being done now daily. That system also needs change all done at the same time as each part effects each other. In conclusion I agree with your  0-5 and 10 dollar fairness plan as long as everything else  is corrected as well and then we will have a real detailed Jubilee that can be used when similar circumstances as stated in the act happen again some day to a person a corporation or a country. Then people could live free for the first time in history. Most people see money as a necessary evil they love it and hate it. We need to take the hate out of it to all be free, because we all know we can&#39;t take it with us. Therefore money if we believe in God or even just a creators individual eternal soul, will finally be reality on this earthly plain and money will not be a god or overly control people but  simply be used for survival and to either better ones self or harm ones self it is up to the individual. But we the people and society must not punish keep a score for punishment and treat all humans equally under the new act. Some may end up better off than others but no one will be hurt by the new act and financial reset. It is easier to set up than you could imagine just follow the existing Bankruptcy rules of insolvency and totally redo them so they are not punitive and fair legal with no stigma attached. Once the new act is designed it can be implemented uniquely to every person and entity or country on he planet fairly. Yes a Jubilee is our only way out for humanity at this point as the debt and this compounding lending credit system must change once and for all. Good luck I hope someone takes some of my suggestions and your plan seriously and implement it within the next 18 months which would be good timing for the world. Meanwhile people need to be told  a little about what is coming and a stimulus program needs to be put into effect ASAP before the country revolts. Keep busy and happy until the new Jubilee Act can be released along with al the other changes. Such a system is easy to set up on computers. The hard part will be distributing a fair package to every soul on the planet at approximately the same time give or take 30 days to implement. The good news is that most current systems could still stay in operation but obviously will need to change to comply with the new Jubilee Act which will be good and fair for all. If adopted even Christ would be pleased keep in mind that without Christ God their can be no human reality."

How come you refused to acknowledge that buying bitcoin or gold over the SP500 has been an absolutely ABYSMAL trade for the last 5 years, maybe until the last month when crypto got a bid? why are you not able to acknowledge your faults as a trader? Oh wait I know.. because the minute you admit that you were wrong for years, your narrative falls apart and you lose subs. So you ignore people who call you out, and offer nothing to those who you HAVE KEPT OUT OF THE MARKET FOR YEARS and are now MUCH WORSE OFF than they would have been had they NOT listened to you? why can&#39;t you acknowledge that? this is a zero-sum game. And you have been on the losing side of the trade for years!!! WITHOUT EVER ACKNOWLEDGING IT!!!!!!!"

10073,Miles Beckler (Expert Digital Entrepreneur/Investor) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 37!,J YH,"Thank you, George. As I commented on some other videos, I appreciate the diversity of voices on your channel.. <br><br>Because of your most popular videos recently and research on the crazy moves of central banks and governments etc, it’s obvious that you attract plenty of angry, suspicious folks. There IS plenty to be angry about.  But I think many folks‘ hobby is simply sitting in their basement and being pissed off, and commenting on YT about what’s wrong with the world (read:  why they hate their life).<br><br>But not everyone is the problem. Not everyone or everything in the world is corrupt and broken. And, if they really looked, they would see that Miles has no course and doesn’t sell anything in this ‘make money‘ space. He is a very positive and constructive person that encourages hard work and persistence (he is literally the opposite of ‘make money fast’). He would not spend his time sitting in a basement and being angry at the world. He really does work hard and he inspires the people that watch him. And that’s it. <br><br>It may be hard for angry, suspicious people to believe someone that doesn’t spend their time pitching the angry, negative ideas they are used to hearing. Maybe those negative ideas are the only ones that such people want to consume. Fact is, some of your last few interviews were with people who make their living off of promoting negative, angry, toxic ideas. because they know there’s a market for it...<br><br>But some people instead take their anger and get to work. They counter the negative in the world by doing good...yes even for their neighbors or people from other communities, or political persuasion or color, or people in other countries. <b>It’s possible to do good and do well in the process.</b><br><br>As noted, “Help more people or help people with bigger problems.” It’s really not groundbreaking. It’s business 101. And whether you do it online or in your local town with individuals or businesses, once you stop bitching about the world and get off your ass, you CAN do better by helping others do better. I think Miles is a good example of this. Thanks again, George, for all you do."

The problem with this approach is that they can manipulate the results of the test to produce any outcome they desire. They can claim you have tested positive for the virus when you actually have nothing. Once they get you into a room with people and maybe only one person may actually have the virus now you and others suddenly just got infected. Picture an emergency room at the hospital and now the virus is spreading inside this environment. It&#39;s just government overreach by calculated design.

10143,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 004!,Tom W,"Patrick is right on how expensive the put side is even on most individual stocks unless they were a consumer staple. I&#39;ve been having a hard time willing to do it, because it costs much more. There is a reason high school drivers pay more than the rest of us though, so that makes sense. One way to limit the downside carry, even though it still is downside carry, is to do the collar much further out. When you take the cost of the insurance out over those number of weeks the insurance is less per week than a shorter term one. For instance a $15 put on CNP for July is $2.55, but only $2.05 for December.  If it is a dividend paying stock you would collect the dividend longer as well. Still, it will cost more for the premium on the put side, but maybe its worth it in these crazy times. If you want to see insane premiums, look at TSLA this morning."

10148,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 004!,Tempus0,"The proposed trade &#39;buy GLD, buy Put, sell Call&#39; is synthetically equal to a debit call spread (and credit put spread). This type of position is called a &#39;reversal conversion&#39;.<br><br><br>The only difference between the spread and the conversion is that you need to use more buying power to hold the GLD stock and for that you&#39;ll be discounted the risk free interest rate (currently about 0.31% in the option market) over the spread."

10172,Government Digital Currency: Why You Should Be TERRIFIED!,gene schmunk,at first it will appear that dissenters will be tolerated and they will try to live outside the system ...but every dissenter is a threat to the new and great system and so they will be blamed for every social and economic ill and be made pariahs ...citizens will turn them in for re-education and &quot;elimination&quot; ...perhaps its time to ask our creator for strength?
10173,Government Digital Currency: Why You Should Be TERRIFIED!,Anxious Beachbum,"Are digital currencies resulting in a violation of our 4th Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures?  Currently, the federal government needs to obtain an Administrative Subpoena to gain access to a person&#39;s bank account.  Local law enforcement agencies need to obtain a search warrant.  The government has no right to the information within our bank accounts.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but digital currencies will allow the government to see ALL financial information within our accounts........every penny that enters, every penny that exits and all activity within, including who we&#39;re doing business with.  We&#39;re not authorizing the gov&#39;t to move forward with the digital currency.  They&#39;ll shoving it down our throats and forcing us to grant access to that which is currently protected by the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."

Artificially printing money out of thin air while at the same time a guy is telling you everything will be all right and problems magically will go away. Many missing rent, car payments and businesses have little to no revenue and falling so far behind on expenses. Most even in the best of times did not even have a $400 emergency and NO amazing health care that was promised. Take a look at <a href=""http://www.usdebtclock.org/"">www.USdebtclock.org</a> and ask yourself if this was the best of times why were we racking up massive debt when we should have been paying it down and now we have this catastrophe.

10209,Lyn Alden (Macro Expert/FinTwit Rockstar!) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 35!,Martin Hovorka,"The money will cause the main street inflation when it hits the mainstream market as Lyn said, however that will not happen from one-two time household stimulus money, but from governments infrastructure projects, investments and subsidies creating demand for raw materials and labor. Raw materials and energy will pick up first, the rest will follow. Watch the EU trillion+ EUR budget that will trickle down to EU members pushing already saturated construction market to accelerated inflation territory."
10210,Lyn Alden (Macro Expert/FinTwit Rockstar!) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 35!,Fan Stanner,"I agree, for the most part with her thesis but must object from her case study of Japan.  It is incorrect to state that Japan suffered no inflation from 2012-2020.  I have lived here during that time and have seen massive inflation in Japan.  Consumer goods have had shrinkflation of 10-20%, taxes on consumer goods increased by 4%.  The NIKKEI doubled and gold had a 200% increase vs the JPY.<br>Luxury goods are up 5-10%, other taxes are through the roof.  And Japanese do indeed own their -0.1% ten years bond---through a pension system that resembles a balloon being popped in several places at once.  The government forces everyone here to pay into that garbage, 22,000 yen a month or the goon squad comes to take it.  The Japanese government pension system is a wastebasket for JGB 10 years.  The country is fascist."
10211,Lyn Alden (Macro Expert/FinTwit Rockstar!) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 35!,Rikard Johansson,... AND the US has a giant trade deficit.. there are no precedents to this toxic mix.
10212,Lyn Alden (Macro Expert/FinTwit Rockstar!) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 35!,Rikard Johansson,The US has a budget deficit they can not realistically close. They MUST sell bonds to get money to pay their bills. There is still some small demand for T-bonds but if the Fed caps the rate on a rate lower than the return the market demands - no one will buy the bonds. On top of this bonds at very low rates does not fulfill their role as a hedge in a 60/40 portfolio - lowering demand for ALL bonds globally.<br><br>The US is in a horrible position. They will not be able to force the world to buy their garbage 30-year bonds at low yields...

10217,Lyn Alden (Macro Expert/FinTwit Rockstar!) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 35!,bonsai treehouse,"Lyn is stretching trying to find an argument. The amount of debt held is dollars far outweighs the  nominal value of debts of those creditor nations. And any Treasuries that are sold can be bought by the FRB. A point that inflationist never get is that the US dollars themselves aren&#39;t just currency, but each dollar created is a dollar of debt. You don&#39;t solve debt with more debt."

10377,Mark Moss (Expert Investor/Entrepreneur) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 32!,Sandy,"George you don&#39;t know what youre talking about!!  You do not understand &quot;money&quot; creation (actually its not money its currency).  The government cannot print and has never printed a single penny of US currency in our post 1913 debt-based monetary system.  EVER.  The Federal Reserve (a non-gov entity) &quot;prints&quot; money for the singular purpose of LENDING IT.  They &quot;buy&quot; (LEND MONEY TO) treasuries from the Treasury, who promises to pay them back plus interest.  The T-Bills are marked up and sold to the primary dealers who mark it up again and lend to banks.  These become reserves upon which ALL &quot;money&quot; creation rests.  It is commercial bank lending at fractional reserve, currently underpinned by 0.81% actual reserves/deposits where ALL &quot;money&quot; creation occurs.  ALL OF IT.  <br><br>Every single penny in circulation is attributable to a commercial bank loan.  So when loans go bad, we have deflation, inflation is not possible unless loan demand is massive, and loans are repaid, and that is usually true.  Only then does the ponzi grow the money supply.  <br><br>Inflation utterly depends on prosperity in our system, long line at the bank? More interest can be charged and more &quot;money&quot; is circulated.  That is why the late 70s price inflation also came with 22% mortgage rates. <br><br>Of the 6 financial collapses of American history, the 1930s being BY FAR the mildest, in every single case the entire &quot;money&quot; supply was nearly or completely extinguished."
10378,Mark Moss (Expert Investor/Entrepreneur) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 32!,Jason Pizzino,"Good interview George! I actually DON&#39;T think that is the ONE LESSON that Mark had to learn... It honestly sounds like his lesson was he didn&#39;t understand market cycles! <br>Going all in on something he was great at, property flipping/investing, made him his wealth (which he later lost). The problem was his timing of the cycle, NOT going all in! <br>Going all in on Bitcoin in 2014 when he found it would NOT have been a mistake ;)<br>Just my two cents :)"

I myself went to the crypto moon...and back since 2013, got greedy and forgot risk management. I survived though and agree with all you say there Mark. I am curious about your, George&#39;s (and others) opinion on something that keeps omitting from most BTC discussions. Does true digital money need fungibility? I am personally invested in both BTC and more so XMR, but truly believe BTC will have to address the privacy/fungibility issue in its base layer. I think newcomers and some maxis are not really aware of the implications of a transparent ledger where everyone can see each others balances and historical transactions. What are your opinions on this and on privacy coins?"

Small businesses can&#39;t even get a government backed loan unless they have: a credit card, a checking account , AND a loan from a big bank.  This provision of the bailout protects the banks not small businesses.  IMHO, the elites of the Fed and Treasury have <b>no clue</b> what the foundation of our economy actually is, and this is why I think the US empire is destined to collapse just like the Soviet Empire did."

10412,Stock Market Crash! Are We At The Bottom? (Answer Revealed),Emil Storgaard,"I have a wierd question: <br>I just put up a fucked up scenario <br><br>1. Ray dalio speaks about a Depression which will include a monetary recunstruction <br>2. After WW2 when many european countries had borrowed money from the US they agreed upon the - Bretton Wood system <br>Here the other european countries currencies values was set in relation to the dollar and the dollar value was set in relation to the value of the US Gold Reserve. <br><br>3. When the US now needed more money Nixon made 1 of the biggest robberies in history of time. He took the Dollar value of the Gold reserve. The US dollar kept is value but the US still had the gold :D. So double up the monney. <br>4. This let to many years of inflation which also ment the gold price many time doublled its value. which was really good when you had a large reserve. <br>5. now the goverments lend as much money as possible and wants its citizens to do the same. (If the dollar should collapse we still have the gold additude) <br><br>6. Now we are in a place in time where there is so much dept. So many coorporation dept, student loans and so on the inner circle see the best way to reset the system. <br>7. How do we do that? - we need some 1 to blame - we put Trump in power by asking help from the Russians - <br>8. We need a war <br>9 We need a distraction lets plant a virus in China <br>10. We go crazy in printing money and buy as many stocks, Physical Gold, rescourses we can get our hands on. Just print till it collapses. We just need to own the stocks, rescourses and gold because the dollar will be worthless. <br>11. We will use fake news as a weapen to make privates and goverments blame eachother so they want see who is to blame. <br>12. Russia will enter Ukraine at first, and the US as a thanks to help Trump into power they will do nothing and make excuses for not doing anything about it<br>13. we will get our new monerary system on our terms after the was and reset all debt to 0  <br>14 We would have repaid all the weaponindustry supporters for the ellection by big time<br>15. The inner circle are back in Power they mad AMERICA GREAT AGAIN<br><br><br>Think about all these meetings Trump had with Putin, Kim jung un and Saudi Arabia<br>Maybe Putin, Saudi Arabia and Trump even set up this oil crisis and are just making a show about it :) <br>Why only interested in the evil leaders? :D <br><br>If you see Trump in any interviews he dont care about lives. He care about some crooked plan. <br><br>Fun fact A big Nixon fan I know of is Roger Stones... hmmmm <br>Fun fact 2 its 50 years since they took the dollar of the gold <br> <br>Happy anniversary"

(Answer Revealed),dlwatib,"I think I can safely predict that the Fed will keep propping up the stock market and helicoptering in more money into the economy at least until we start seeing inflation of consumer items exceeding 2% per annum.

10427,Chris Macintosh (Pandemic Investing Tips Part 2) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 31!,Cary Hawkins,"@ispamalot I hope you stayed with them.  Jeez, what a turnaround!"
10428,Chris Macintosh (Pandemic Investing Tips Part 2) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 31!,Norsefalconer,"@Conscious Observer I agree with your precept, but not the valuation (unless there&#39;s massive dollar devaluation). The reasoning being that when it becomes profitable to mine again, those inflows will balance the market. Also, there may be a substantial spike in there, where speculators will dump on the market having the same result. I think physical at $100~150ish (usd) is a likely nearer term valuation, and possibly a new base for awhile after. A 20:1 reset would put physical gold at $2000, which is likely near term as well. My 2¢."
10429,Chris Macintosh (Pandemic Investing Tips Part 2) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 31!,Conscious Observer,sandy sefi Silver so the premise of your whole argument rests on the notion that silver is not liquid because central banks don’t hold it....<br><br>Well have you ever thought Central Banks don’t hold it on purpose because silver was the people’s money while gold was the money of the rich and they demonetized silver on purpose so they could get rid of the bimetallic gold and silver coin standard and move to a bullion exchange standard where only the central banks hold gold and we all exchange claims on gold that only other central banks can redeem but not we the people. And finally they completely got rid of even the gold backing and went to completely fiat debt based currencies instead of money... <br><br>Thus your argument that silver “is not liquid enough to be a monetary metal” is just pure nonsense silver is very liquid irrelevant of the fact if central banks hold it or not. The bid ask spread is super tiny on silver meaning it is a very liquid market:)

10431,Chris Macintosh (Pandemic Investing Tips Part 2) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 31!,sandy sefi,"@Conscious Observer &quot;&gt; Well my argument is silver is also still a monetary metal&quot;<br><br>Hmm no it is not. There is a such a good point about LIQUIDITY made in the video that you need to pay attention to: Silver is just not LIQUID enough to be a &quot;monetary&quot; asset. <br><br>Ask yourself the question, How much silver does central banks held as reserve? <br>- None, because it is not liquid enough. <br><br>Gold, on the other hand...."

There are moral and immoral ways of behaviour going on in the economic arenas and ultimately we have to look at this part. For example a lot of the Feds actions are immoral and it’s a way to accumulate wealth for a few individuals. We have to insert a discussion of morality into how the Fed, Government and treasury operate. When you and Chris were discussing the Ego driven personalities of the individuals, you were right about that, however, it’s also a moral issue - theft, fraud, and putting wealth into the hands of a very few people. You almost get there. Would love to hear a few guests discuss this with you. Thanks for your continued excellent content."

With bitcoin, where there is potentially a drop as experienced lately, it should be seen as a potential to buy. The current correction in reality is long overdue and should be seen as a thing of joy as the dump is very temporal and also provides a unique time to grow your portfolio. Everyone seems to be guessing and getting even more confused about the future. The only constant thing I can say for sure is that traders are actually earning good returns, while the hodlers are always worried about what the future holds for Bitcoin... With the insight, skills and experience of an expert trader like Floyd Edward , the sky is the limit. Floyd Edward’s daily signals are very accurate and always yield a great positive return on investment and he is always available to give a helping hand on Whatsapp (+13617177129) or Telegram (floyd_signal27) for inquiries into his signal and trading services."

10529,"Real Estate Market: Will It CRASH? If So, When? (Answered)",Tony Rodrigues,"When the Fed bails out financial entities, they are essentially saying, your bad decisions don&#39;t matter, we will reward you for your mistakes.  How long can they play this game without real world consequences?  How long can they destroy value of the currency before people say enough.  All these bailouts are essentially WELFARE for the rich.  So trillions are given to the rich for bad  decisions and the poor are thrown a bone in a $1200 one time check.  How long before people just stop paying taxes?  Stop paying mortgages because the Fed will bail out the leveraged mortgage holder.  so money and debt don&#39;t matter if the Fed is running rogue.  When will people unite and bring out the pitchforks?"
10530,"Real Estate Market: Will It CRASH? If So, When? (Answered)",Tony Rodrigues,"@ George Gammon.  why would home prices fall if the Fed is pumping liquidity into the system.  The Fed is bailing out every financial institution, hedge fund etc and they are setting a precedent for bailouts of other institutions that could potentially become insolvent.  IN turn this means is that the dollar is toilet paper except we are not using it as such for now.  If the liquidity they are providing is in the form of LOANS, then it means the money has to be paid back albeit at some later date which has the opposite implications for the dollar.  So the real choice is will the Fed ever allow these entities to default, if not, then hyperinflation is the only end result that destroys any semblance of value in the dollar.  By extension that means we have to hang on to tangibles and real estate.  The stock market just represents the distortion created by the Fed and while the Fed has extended all kinds of bailout programs to prop it up today, the real question is can they keep it up forever.  Because that means the Fed can never get out of the bailout business and it creates the moral hazard of institutions leveraging themselves hugely because they would get bailed out."

My argument was focused solely on the KOL dividend and my goal was to explain why the 13% - 17% divi should not be relied on when deciding to invest. I am not arguing whether KOL or the coal sector is or isn&#39;t a good investment, or where it will be in 5 or 10 years. That&#39;s a whole different topic. I agree we have completely different investment strategies and I am not in any way criticizing yours. Far from it.

10563,Chris Macintosh (Pandemic Investing Tips) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 29!,George Gammon,"@IxI I think you&#39;re cherry picking data points and making several inaccurate assumptions about the way I invest.  1.  Assuming it doesn&#39;t get expensive, I&#39;ll hold an investment 10 years plus.  I could care less what the price of the stock is the day after I buy, 3 years after I buy, or 5 years after I buy.  An investment means I get paid to own an asset, just like a rental property.  If the value of a rental prop paying me 10% goes down in value by X% do I care? No.  You&#39;re focusing on short term paper loses or gains.  2. Many of the coal companies filed for chapter 11 in 2016ish so you can&#39;t compare current balance sheets to pre BK, therefore their ability to pay dividend.  3. Let&#39;s assume they slash the dividend by 50%, ok now I&#39;m making 8.5% for 2 of the min. 10 years I plan to hold the stock.  For a moment let&#39;s assume, due to the strong balance sheets, they continue to pay for 5 years.  I have my principal back and you&#39;re playing with the houses money.  4.  I&#39;m using 17% because that&#39;s where I bought it.  5.  You&#39;re looking at worst case scenarios only, when analyzing risk/reward you have to look at worst case and best case and probabilities.<br><br><br>Another fun thought experiment, go through your list.  Could you&#39;ve said the exact same thing about the rental properties I bought in 2012 (translating into real estate language)?  Yes... ;)<br><br><br><br>I think the discrepancy comes from 2 completely different strategies.  You are looking at stocks as vehicles to buy, sell, trade for capital gains, for you holding a stock for a year is a &quot;very long time.&quot;  I&#39;m simply buying a business (the current balance sheet and P&amp;L, not the one from 2008 or 2016), just like a gas station on the corner, to me a share price doesn&#39;t exist after I buy.  One isn&#39;t right or wrong, just different.  It&#39;ll be fun to revisit in 3 years and see what KOL has done. ;)"

I said I wasn&#39;t going to give away any of the investing ideas Chris and I talk about BUT I CHANGED MY MIND!!  haha  One speculation we discuss is going long oil tankers.  Because of the demand crash the oil spot price is lower than future price (contango) so big players buy today, sell futures, then store the oil on a tanker at sea, lock in guaranteed profit.  This takes oil tankers offline, rates go up.  I thought this was a very interesting idea.  What do you think?  Let me know below, then I&#39;ll know you read the pinned comment!

If Australia fares well next quarter, and doesn&#39;t enter a recession, that is. Which it most likely will, but until then it should be steadily on the rise and at least get back to 68-70c against the US dollar.  Maybe higher. It&#39;s currently 65c.

10674,Lynette Zang (Legendary Market Analyst) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 27!,Savage Hornpoke,"I looked through the inventories of many online gold brokers, and they are all out of gold and silver. And be careful, the gold and silver bars they can get are coming from China and are counterfeit--silver filled with copper, gold filled with tungsten. Purchase a specific gravity test kit to be sure your gold and silver are gold and silver inside. why copper inside silver?--because it passes the hysterisis test. Why tungsten?--because it has almost the density of gold. A mixture of layered tungsten and layered depleted uranium may have the exact density of gold and can even fool the specific gravity test. Or they put voids in the tungsten so that its density is exactly that of gold. So you need to do sonogram test on your gold to look for the voids--and see the layerings.  If you try to drill a hole through tungsten, it will burn up your drill bit tip. Turning a bar into jewelry by drilling a small chain hole you will discover if it is gold or tungsten."

10680,Lynette Zang (Legendary Market Analyst) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 27!,Mike Sharp,"Thanks for doing this interview Lynette.     Question:  How does reduction in debt load affect the inflation picture?   Just with a quick search (i might be wrong) there is 200 Tril debt in the public and private sector in the US.   This is much larger than the actual money in the system (something like 4 or 5 trillion M2), but they are both money.   So if debt gets cut by 2% via people defaulting on mortgages, restructurings etc, in this recessionary period, then that is an 8 Trillion reduction in money/debt and the Fed printing 8 Tril would only offset that loss.   This seems to be what Dalio suggests when he says that the printing doesn&#39;t actually create the inflation that we expect.   Anyway, if you could do a video on that concept, I would very much appreciate it.  Thanks George and Lynette!"

10694,Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Explodes! Why Is Dollar Up/Gold Down?,Kevin Lewis,I am told that the Government quietly took control of the FED under Donald Trump and since our money is no longer backed by gold at the moment the FED is buying all these assets to make it so our money is backed by assets that way we can start moving back to the gold standard. That is also why Trump is trying to bring manufacturing self sufficiency back to the US. This way we settle our problems the Middle East is starting to settle its problems and we can help other countries settle there problems at home and not have a massive influx of immigration.

I really like it when you have guests that explain how previous monetary stimulation resulted in inflation of asset prices in ETFs and housing I think statements like this are much more predictive of what we should expect to see than almost all of what Mr. shift says. I’m sure he’s right at some point gold will go to $1 billion an ounce just like he was right 10 years in advance of the last recession but being early is as they say the same as being wrong. I’m sure the vast majority of the people that are watching your show in these trying times are looking for guidance in the immediate future looking forward four months and six months and 18 months focusing on these things and capitalizing on the immediate opportunity that stands screaming at us in our faces should not be ignored and we shouldn’t expect billion dollar gold in the next 18 months it’s foolish

There is no distinguishing from money created  by lending and any other money in the system be it &quot;Wealthy friends &quot; or anywhere.  The money wealthy friends may put up as capital or assets comprises of all sorts of money including money from borrowing which was created from bank lending.  There is no distinguishing between any sort of money once it enters the economy. There is only a distinction in terms of who got it first to spend or save or do whatever else with it.  So Keen has not thought that through and is wrong."
10866,Steve Keen (Rebel Economist/Mathematician) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 25!,Rob,Steve Keene claims to be a mathematically competent in economics however he is confused about sectoral balances in the economy being unable to distinguish between private sector savings and balances between the sectors. This is Not uncommon for economists to confuse the two different concepts of savings and sectoral balance and is one of the downfalls of economists that adhere to Keynesian and post Keynesian economics.   <br>In his confusion he claims that deficits in the government sector produce savings in the private sector which is clearly wrong since savings in the private sector only come from spending less than one earns. It&#39;s a fact that nobody can reasonably argue against.
10867,Steve Keen (Rebel Economist/Mathematician) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 25!,TMB,"I don&#39;t get Steve Keen&#39;s argument at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSlVLg83iNc&amp;t=24m00s"">24:00</a>. Why can&#39;t everyone in society have a positive equity? Just because a bank needs net positive equity that doesn&#39;t mean everyone else has to have negative. &quot;Every asset that someone has is someone else&#39;s liability..&quot; hmm, not sure I follow that either."
10868,Steve Keen (Rebel Economist/Mathematician) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 25!,TMB,"Ok, I think this is like Warren Mosler&#39;s argument that since the government is the sole provider of money in an economy (not actually true) then for people to have net positive money in their bank accounts then government spending must be greater than taxation i.e. government is in debt. As I say I think this is flawed as the government is not the sole provider of money."

10872,Steve Keen (Rebel Economist/Mathematician) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 25!,Geoff Strowger,"I&#39;m not a trained economist and confess I haven&#39;t actually read Keynes&#39; tome, but have a vague sense that what Keynes originally proposed, which was that at the margin one can (to some extent) modulate demand by injecting government money.  What I thought I heard Steve say seemed not dissimilar (forgive the double negative) ...... am I wrong? (BTW, I am about 3 degrees of separation from Keynes (across generations)!)"
10873,Steve Keen (Rebel Economist/Mathematician) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 25!,Jillian M,"Wow. So much to unpack here. Thank you for expanding my horizons, George...like you, I’m a big free market gal so I’ll have to watch this a second time to better solidify the concepts Keen was explaining. One thing I wish you guys would have covered is a topic that Jim Rickards touches on a lot, and that is the notion that an increase in government debt can create an even greater increase in GDP (which I think Keen was saying here), but only when the government debt to GDP ratio is below a certain level (if memory serves, that level is roughly in the 60-90% range, values which I believe Rickards gets from studies by Reinhart and Rogoff). Anyway, Rickards (via Reinhart &amp; Rogoff) conclude (by studying 800 years of history, and particularly the last 200ish of the US), that once government debt to GDP goes too far beyond 60%, particularly once it is above 90%, then the extra government spending actually results in the destruction of currency/credit/growth because it results in lower GDP. A simple example to illustrate their point would be that when debt to GDP is only 50%, for every $1.00 the government spends, $1.10 is created in GDP for example, which is a net positive; but if debt to GDP is 100%, then for every $1.00 government spends, it only generates $0.90 in GDP, a net negative. Anyway, I hope I&#39;m not too far off base here, but I would love to hear Keen&#39;s thoughts on this concept by Reinhart and Rogoff which Rickards explains so often. Thanks for all the great content, George! Keep it up!"

Hardcore anarcho-capitalist, in the Rothbardian and Misesian tradition."
10877,Steve Keen (Rebel Economist/Mathematician) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 25!,Tenebrousable,His whole tirade as he was trying to explain the deficit spending making people richer? You know how you couldn&#39;t follow it? Because it doesn&#39;t make a lick of sense.
10878,Steve Keen (Rebel Economist/Mathematician) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 25!,Tenebrousable,"For example, one of his basic arguments, that inform his whole worldview, that I&#39;ve heard him hammer everytime before I&#39;ve heard him speak, is upside down. &quot;Government deficit spending makes citizens have surpluss,&quot; or something to that effect, right?. Again, upside down. Spending the money isn&#39;t the issue. It&#39;s spending the resource. Human and material resource. Government deficit spends more resource than the economy can generate. Surpluss it doesn&#39;t create. <br><br><br><br>If economy generates x eggs, and government taxes 10%, and spends 20% (10% deficit), citizens won&#39;t have 100% eggs, but 80%. Keens moddle would indeed say 100%, if he were to understand his own model."

10884,Alex Saunders (Crypto Expert) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 24,Darren P,Really shallow on Ripple can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t bring up the on demand liquidy. My opinion on ripple/xrp is they aren&#39;t trying to reinvent the wheel they are just trying to improve upon the current system. That seems like it would have a much easier time to be adopted. Its the fastest most efficient blockchain network and they have been working with regulators from the very beginning. Why would anyone use a bitcoin over their own country&#39;s currency domestically? What use cases does  bitcoin have that ripple/xrp can&#39;t do and how is bitcoin faster or more efficient? The whole cryptocurrency market is speculation the only advantage i can see bitcoin has had is that the sheep have heard about it and are told by tribal holders look how high the price could go or has gone never really talking about the utility. No one buys cars the way they do cryptocurrency they look at features and stats not what was first if that was the case we would have never moved past the model T.

10951,Repo Market Goes NUCLEAR! Fed Unleashes Bazookas. How Will It Affect YOU?,Liberty Springs,"@Asym_Investing we have had high inflation since around 1970. The banks have authorization to create money every time they make a loan (it is not just other peoples savings they lend out). So if the banks get nervous and stop making so many new loans (since people might not pay them back), then inflation suddenly stops so house prices and everything will drop instead of keep rising. The fed tries to plug the hole by printing QE but it might not be enough. They really need to print 4 trillion asap and give 10k to each person in the u.s. but congress would have to authorize that so it&#39;s unlikely.

10984,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 003!,D. J.,"Just a word of caution here:   the bought side of these trades, in even a modestly uprising stock will ALWAYS cost money (expire worthless)...if you choose a CALL TO NEAR ITM, then your position could be exercised away AND the put cost will erode profits.   PEOPLE SHOULD START with BUY-WRITES first, to get the hang of this, and by that I mean:  COVERED CALLS."
10985,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 003!,Eric Gamliel,"After watch this video I began studying covered call options---for a few days now and my conclusion is that THEY ARE VERY RISKY.  You have to be a psychic to know what strike price and expiration to pick.  It&#39;s much better to have a well balanced portfolio of non-correlated assets.  Invest in assets that, in the event they go down, you will be ECSTATIC to buy more.  No crystal ball is needed, just good ol fashioned research."

10990,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 003!,0xAA4214C,As long as you trust the system...<br>What about counter party risk? What if your counter party goes bankrupt in turbulent market conditions? Then you just flushed some more money down the toilet... insurance...lol...it&#39;s more like luck based investing in these current conditions.
10991,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 003!,REAL P&L,"First let me say that as far as being educational about how options work this is a great video. But I need to say that purchasing options is a losing proposition and I think this point needs to be added to the education. Regarding the PSX hedge. $827 was paid to hedge a $22,626 position for 2 weeks. That hedge cost was 827/22,626 =3.6%. If you spend 3.6% hedging every 2 weeks it would cost around 93% per year in hedge costs!!  Not good money management. The real point here is that you have to be directional and pick and chose when you hedge because you cannot put on a consistent hedge. Good luck knowing when PSX is going down significantly in order to cover your hedge costs. Statistically this is a losing trade! If I knew the direction I would just buy the put without buying the underlying."
10992,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 003!,Agent-86,"Yes, I know the VIX is based on futures prices of various SPX options and, &quot;trading the VIX,&quot; is actually trading the underlying options. Shorting the VIX is an attempt to capture the roll yield (theta) of those options. What I&#39;m wondering is if the many people shorting the VIX (through various instruments) aren&#39;t in effect writing insurance thus increasing the supply and decreasing the cost of that insurance? I hope that makes sense."

You will discover they are 100x more severe and deadlier than the Cerveza sickness. Currently there are 150,000 or so cases of the Cerveza. Only 5300 are fatal. That&#39;s a .037% fatality rate. The other pathogens are far more efficient killers. Cerveza has a 95-98% survival rate. Those who die are the elderly, infants or people with compromised immune systems. Not everyone who gets Cerveza gets hospitalized or is in AIDS mode hospitalization. This is called Nosophobia (the fear of contracting an illness). Society has absolutely gone mad at this level!!  People are in Herd mentality. Where was that medical expert a few years ago when cases of Ebola popped up in the U.S. Ebola is very contagious and has a fatality rate of over 30%.

11055,Marc Faber (Investment Legend) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 22!,John Galt,"Money is nothing more or less than stored labor. If you spend time climbing a tree to get a banana it will go bad in a few days. You must eat it or trade it in a specific time period. Money (gold) is unique no matter what you do to it, it always returns to its core state without any evaporation or lessening. That is why for over 5,000 years it has been used as money. Paper can be destroyed, burned. It cannot be returned to paper. If everyone has free money they have no reason to work. Eventually it will become survival of the fittest, un-lazy. Why would i work for you when i can get my money for free. Nobody would do anything fir anyone leaving everyone to be forced to everything for themselves. Imagine that, personal responsibility. When govts cheat by printing money they teach the masses they do not have to have personal responsibility. And then they make up adjectives to remove freedom like “assault” weapons. “Hate” speech. They know they meed to disarm the people because it will all eventually crash all all currency in all of time has but gold. There is no currency other than gold in use today that is over 300 years old. The avg collapse of currency is 275 years. They need an unarmed populace, that was taught no work ethic, no personal responsibilities and always have their hand out for free stuff because they are spoiled and like a spoiled kid they eventually riot and cause revolution. They need you all unarmed and soon...."

I didn&#39;t have time to mention in many of the shale producers will go bust as a result of these oil prices, and that will sow the seeds of the next bull market in oil.  3.  Lower energy costs significantly lower costs for the miners.  Very bullish. 4. The interest rates on the investment grade debt above BBB in could also go up not down.  Depends on several variable which would be another video.  5.  The reason I say there&#39;s no buyers of corporate debt is because the main buyer (Pension Funds) could be gone.

11169,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 002,Mr. Fusion,"I repeat. Do NOT do this. Especially in 401K. In the silver example if silver had shot up, like most people expect, the put would be worthless and your shares would be gone. Options are insanely risky which is why you either make big or lose everything. Do not let anyone tell you such and such will reduce risk and options are investing"
11170,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 002,Mr. Fusion,"My sincere apologies George, but this is fake news.  Options IS risky because of the time component, both when you buy and the strike price/date. In worst case you can lose everything, more so in a volatile market. Eg<br><br>i buy 100 apple shares <br>Buy a put to hedge<br>Sell a call to offset put price <br><br>Stock jumps up 10% (did today just before close), call gets exercised, i lose my shares and put is worthless. <br><br>Sure you can sell way OTM calls/puts but that gives you pennies on the dollar with higher risk. If options were that easy to strategize everyone would be doing it. <br><br>Having said that : they r a good tool for some fun, hedging and side income. But in no way are they investing."

11181,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 002,REAL P&L,"@CookItKeto I understand that short naked puts are not the only strategy but if you had any, that small portion of your account could have possibly blown up the rest of the account. I heard a lady call in that was short the SPY at the 312 strike put. She is down $8400 when she was trying to make maybe $200. You only need a couple of those to blow up."
11182,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 002,CookItKeto,REAL P&amp;L I’ve switched to a long Vega short beta weighted delta portfolio. Short puts aren’t the only trade they espouse lol
11183,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 002,REAL P&L,CookItKeto One of the main problems is selling naked puts. Their system in general is under hedged. Can I ask how the capital you have allocated to the tastytrade methodology has worked for you over the last month? Are you a directional trader/investor? I don’t recall tastytrade being long Vega or directional unless you are scalping.
11184,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 002,CookItKeto,"REAL P&amp;L id like to understand what exactly about their methodology is unsound?<br><br>The only flaw I can see is that they often count on IV mean reversion, but they do also trade long Vega strategies. Realistically, i don’t see anything unsound about trading small, and often, selling premium when it’s expensive, ignoring most talking heads, rolling losers to scratch, and being a contrarian when it comes to stretched trends on high quality companies."

11191,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 002,REAL P&L,Yes especially with the wide bid ask spreads. The market makers are making a killing in this market. If I could get a decent price it would significantly reduce my risk!

11203,Repo Market Oversubscribed AGAIN! Fed Loses Control (WTF Is Happening?),George Gammon,"NOTE:  The most important part of this video, by far, is STEP #2.  I&#39;d like to encourage everyone to do their best to understand how the Fed&#39;s money printing (creating reserves) gets into the system, or doesn&#39;t get into the system.  The transfer mechanism is banks, if they don&#39;t create additional deposits in the form of lending or buying financial assets, the reserves don&#39;t get into the system.  The Fed could print another 100 trillion and it wouldn&#39;t matter, the reserves would be nothing more than electronic digits on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet.  Thx for watching everyone!  ;)"

11205,Repo Market Oversubscribed AGAIN! Fed Loses Control (WTF Is Happening?),cn768623,"@Kholke kholke The value of anything is ultimately based on its use to society.  Because certain materials, such as gold, have been hoarded, the price of the metals has been kept artificially high.  Because the prices have been so high, there has been much less research into how to use the metals productively.  As a result, precious metals have actually declined in value relative to everything else in society, including non-precious metals.  There are literally thousands upon thousands upon thousands of tons of gold sitting around doing nothing but collecting dust.  If any of that gold was to actually make it to the market, the market price of gold would plummet.  Banks and gold merchants know that, hence they&#39;re very willing to sell it but much more careful when buying it.<br><br>Ironically, overtime the goldbugs&#39; wishes may come true - gold will become so worthless relative to everything else that people will actually use it as money!<br><br>I thought I would add a quote I found on Wikipedia, allegedly from a book by economist Thomas Sowell:<br>&quot;&#39;To take an extreme example [of price volatility], while a dollar invested in bonds in 1801 would be worth nearly a thousand dollars by 1998, a dollar invested in stocks that same year would be worth more than half a million dollars in real terms.

11208,Repo Market Oversubscribed AGAIN! Fed Loses Control (WTF Is Happening?),cn768623,"​@dreams and other stuff In short, I think the banks do not trust each other&#39;s viability because the problems that wreaked havoc in 2008 were never solved.  Why I think that is a very long story.<br><br><br>In essence there are 3 kinds of money the public uses in this system.  There is Real Money (cold hard cash), which is authorized and printed by the US Treasury [about $1.5 trillion].  There is As-Good-As-Real-Money, which are US Treasuries (essentially the government saying that they do not want to print more money, but if need be, they will print this much money) [about $17.2 trillion].  Finally, there is Pseudo-Money [about $45-55 trillion in the US and trillions more created outside the US].  <br><br><br>Pseudo-Money is the money created by the private sector through debt issuance (which is later securitized).  It affects and is factored into prices and wages just like Real Money and As-Good-As-Real-Money are, but unlike them, Pseudo-Money is not permanently in the system because only the US government has the authority to issue US dollars, not the private sector.  The amount of Pseudo-Money in the system can go down (when someone pays back a loan, if a loan is written down or if a loan is wiped out in bankruptcy) or it can go up (when someone takes out a new loan).  If the total amount of money in the system goes down, then prices and wages will also go down.  <br><br><br>Thus far, all US dollar contracts are written with the expectation that the total amount of money in the system will increase (i.e. there is a positive interest rate).  Unless the government pumps more Real Money or As-Good-As-Real-Money into the system, then the total amount of money in the system will increase only if the amount of Pseudo-Money in the system increases.  People will take out loans faster than they are paying them off, thus increasing Pseudo-Money, only if they believe incomes will rise in the future.  Incomes can rise only if money is invested.  The total amount of income in a system is the GDP.<br><br><br>An investment is not what most people think it is (putting X amount of money in and getting more money back; if that was the case, Ponzi schemes would be investments). An investment is using resources in an attempt to increase the efficiency of production, to develop new products/services or to expand production capacity.  An investment is only an investment if it is potentially viable (assuming it works out) while keeping the total amount of money in the system constant.  An investment is not Consumption (ex. borrowing money to buy anything more than minimal housing), Rent-Seeking and other anti-competitive behaviors (the cause of most income inequality), Speculation (holding something in the off-chance that someone will pay you more for it later, ex. gold) or a Ponzi Scheme (many housing markets were and are Ponzi Schemes - increasing loan size and duration to increase prices, then repeating by using the newly gained equity as a down payment on another home).<br><br><br>If money is invested, then income/GDP will rise stably and steadily and the Total Debt/GDP ratio will at worse remain the same and, at best, decrease.<br><br><br>The problem in the US is that from the early 1970&#39;s to 2008, much Pseudo-Money was created, but very little was invested - most of it was used for Consumption, Rent-Seeking, Speculation or Ponzi Schemes.  This led to a skyrocketing Total Debt/GDP ratio - from about 150% Debt/GDP in the early 1970&#39;s to 365% Debt/GDP in 2009 to about 340% Debt/GDP today - we transformed from a wealth creating economy into a rent-seeking economy.  See graphs, <a href=""https://www.nwcapitalsolutions.com/project/us-deleveraging-analysis-total-debt-to-gdp/"">https://www.nwcapitalsolutions.com/project/us-deleveraging-analysis-total-debt-to-gdp/</a>; <a href=""http://fat-pitch.blogspot.com/2016/10/has-us-debt-reached-tipping-point.html"">http://fat-pitch.blogspot.com/2016/10/has-us-debt-reached-tipping-point.html</a><br><br><br>Because debt/Pseudo-Money increased so rapidly relative to incomes, people/businesses became less able to service their debts, so there was an increase in people/businesses paying back their debts or declaring bankruptcy and fewer people taking on new debts.  This led to prices and wages falling, which would have led to further bankruptcies (and a potential deflationary spiral with a depression and resetting of prices) if the government did not act. It acted by increasing the amount of Treasuries/As-Good-As-Real-Money in the system, which countered the amount of Pseudo-Money that was needed but not being created.  Unfortunately, much of the new money was used to pay off the Rent-Seekers and Speculators, and nothing was done to fundamentally change the system to encourage investment and end borrowing for Consumption, Rent-Seeking, Speculation and Ponzi Schemes.  <br><br><br>Additionally, the government&#39;s actions, if they were going to prop up prices, were not strong enough - they injected about $10 trillion, but tens of trillions more were required to boost wages and inflate away the debt problem.  As such, we are still in a position where prices/debts are high relative to wages.  This means that without further/constant support from the US government, prices will want to collapse and people/businesses will not be able to pay back their loans.  These loans are securitized and some are on the banks&#39; balance sheets (others are held by investors/pension funds).  Because the securitized loans could go bad at any minute, the banks don&#39;t trust the securities or the viability of the banks that hold them."

11219,Repo Market Oversubscribed AGAIN! Fed Loses Control (WTF Is Happening?),yjfoo23,"George, I disagree with you when you said no inflation has occurred when the Fed buys treasury from a PDB.  By definition, when you have less asset and more cash in the system, that&#39;s called inflation.  Of course in theory if the PDB doesn&#39;t do anything with that extra reserve cash no price increase would happen, but in reality the PDB is in business to make a profit.  It doesn&#39;t make sense for them to just hold on to the deposits and do nothing with it.  For sure they will sooner of later buy some income producing assets, ie. treasuries, with that extra cash on hand."

11250,Coronavirus Investing: How To Build Wealth In A Crisis!,J Scott Hamilton,"@nickolas waterfield I can speak to Tailored Brands, having worked for the JAB segment. It is a brilliantly organized vertically integrated mens clothier that has been horribly managed as of late. But on the JAB side they manufacture all over the world and don&#39;t have that much exposure to China and can shift mfr to different parts. Good inventory management, respectable e-commerce with click&amp;mortar capabilities.<br><br><br>The stock is broken when they suspended the dividend to pay down debt due to acquisitions, but that just means they will be paying debt quicker once they get their strategy sorted out. And they brought in outside talent to do that. They will be impacted by COVID on the demand side for awhile but unlikely on the supply side. The stock has been in a trading range of about 3.25 to 4 with an obscenely low P/E. It would probably make a good dividend stock when they reinstate the dividend, but you&#39;ll probably have to wait 12 - 18 months before the stock becomes unbroken again.<br><br><br>Some would call it a value trap, but I say it has the value now that you would expect at the very bottom of  a financial crisis."
11251,Coronavirus Investing: How To Build Wealth In A Crisis!,m&m,"After thought on this video, I have a 4th you can add to your Probability,Volume,Asymmetry thesis.  Time.  A highly probable asymmetric event that occurs 100 years from now is not the same as a highly probable asymmetric event that occurs tomorrow because, like the beer virus (its the rate of growth that is just as important as the mortality), long term profitability depends on growth over time.  Also the reason why buy and hold works about as well as buy/low sell high of technical analysis is that the time waiting to buy leads to a lost opportunity of growth that might have occurred in the mean time.  Try this on computer models that take random stocks and random years.  The reason moving averages fails is because the algorithm gets trapped where a stock remains overpriced, but continues to grow and this can happen for extended periods of years leading to a lost opportunity to get into the growth.  So if you buy/low sell high there is probability and asymmetry, but it if time is involved you must also account for the opportunity loss and ensure that reserving capital to strike must generally be matched by a negatively correlated opportunity.  This is why stock/bond diversification works only if you regularly rebalance.  Anyway some food for you to think about and discuss in your upcoming videos which I always enjoy."

11260,Coronavirus Investing: How To Build Wealth In A Crisis!,Desmond Jordan,"George You certainly nailed it with this anslysis. Now that the crash has started have any of your views or observations changed? What are the best free screening tools that could help the prudent value investor start identify some of the stocks who might fit the value and probability criteria you talk about in a post crash recession in which there is also p/e multiple compression coupled with lower earnings? <br>Also can the law of large numbers be part of what causes the bubble? For example a lot of the program trading for Index funds and some ETFs have been buying the same large stocks irrespective of absolute fundamentals pushing up the their prices and p/e ratios. Sometimes this is done by program trading so no real rational thought. As relative value matters too, this pushes up the value of secondary stocks as well I assume, until everything is over valued and the house of cards comes crashing down. At that point everyone is trying to get out the falling build at once. Michael Burry and others have talked about this. What do you think?"
11261,Coronavirus Investing: How To Build Wealth In A Crisis!,Phill Huddleston,"I don&#39;t know if investing in a cruse line is a good idea at any price, my guess is that after this virus is over it will be years before most people want to go on a cruise ship. Psychologically people will be effected by the apparent risk of COVID-19 for a long time and will change their habits because of it. Before Corona hit people were aware of the risk of getting a virus, now the risk will be seen as too high for most people, if the cruise ship companies can hold out five years it may be a good investment but that is too high of a risk right now.

It might not be effective, but it&#39;s not <b>all</b> just talk, is it?

I would love to revisit the colateral shortage problem by connecting it together with your more recent videos where you more lean towards the more mainstream money devaluation thesis. Seems to me that &quot;money printing propaganda&quot; has its media short term effects in the short run but in the end the economy and investors run into the dollar and colateral shortage wall where stocks and treasury yiels go another floor lower. how does this fit the gold thesis? do you see gold as a kind of pristine colateral just as US-Treasuries are except gold trust ETF&#39;s are for some reason not used in the repo market?

11359,Everything You've Been Told About Money Creation Is WRONG!,Elo Black,"Hey there George, I have really been trying to wrap my brain around this banking system.  I could not even be as clear or confused without your help.  Thank you so much for all your efforts in explaining for me to even have a chance in understanding(it&#39;s a process, I&#39;m undertaking!).  So my question, if fractional lending, is really &quot;currency creation&quot;  Then a so-called &quot;run on the banks&quot; has nothing to do with 90% of my deposit being lent, and only 10% kept in reserve,  as much as it has to do with the actual &quot;liquidity&quot;  of physical cash being available.  My &quot;currency&quot; is kept in the bank reserve, the currency lent was created, not taken out of my deposit?  I&#39;m I close to being on track here.    &quot;A run on the bank&quot; has nothing to do with reserves being lent?"

Thanks."
11370,Everything You've Been Told About Money Creation Is WRONG!,Michael Thudén,"Banks don&#39;t create currency (see my comment below)  - only the central banks create currency. The banks use the central bank money they hold at their central banks accounts (digital currency) to clear the debt between each others at the end of the day (the so called clearing system). Banks only have a very limited amount of digital cash at the central bank in proportion to the amount of debt they push around their customers accounts when transactions are made (your account is the banks debt on currency to you - NOT currency -- the bank pay part of its debt when you for instance make a withdrawal from the ATM). <br><br>The small pool of currency a bank hold in order to be able to clear it&#39;s debt to other banks may evaporate very fast if for instance many people make withdrawals (so called bankruns). If the clearing system at the central banks halts the whole payment system halts. So the central bank are more or less forced to inject digital currency on the banks account at the central bank (injects liquidity) if the liquidity dries up.<br><br>We hardly use currency (physical cash) when we pay each other - we use the banks debt (the credit the account holder given the bank) instead when we pay each other through the banks payment system. Only 3% of the money supply (M3) consists of currency - the rest, 97%, are the banks debt (credit) to account holders on currency. <br><br>Some central banks are planing to make digital currency available to all (the banks have today an oligopoly on the digital currency at the central banks). I would then be able to pay you directly with (digital) currency from my central bank account to your central bank account bypassing the banks payment system. The banks are therefore , of course, against letting all be able to use digital currency. One obvious reason is that there would  probably be digital bankrun where  people moved the account at the bank to a central banks account."

11372,Everything You've Been Told About Money Creation Is WRONG!,Michael Thudén,"Banks don&#39;t create currency at all - only the central banks create currency. From Bank of England report:<br><br>&quot;Broad money is made up of bank deposits — which are essentially IOUs from commercial banks to households and companies — and currency — mostly IOUs from the centralbank.(4)(5)Of the two types of broad money, bank deposits make up the vast majority — 97% of the amount currently in circulation.&quot;<br><br>This is true for almost all central banks in the world. <br><br><br><br>Hence 97% of the broad money is NOT currency. - only 3% is currency. 97% of the broad money consists of credit that the holder of the bank account has given to the bank. So the customer is the creditor - not the bank - when the bank make what they call a &quot;loan&quot;.  So it&#39;s the opposite to what the bank claim as Richard Werner explains in the video below with balance sheets.

No. USA will help China (wtf, Robert, what are you talking about?). USA will allow IMF to be very important and to make SDR very important. Consciously to make SDR a new, very young and fresh reserve currency (Jim Rickards). Why would the US get rid of the dollar as a reserve? Becouse then they have free hand to solve their own problems -&gt; No Eurodollar problem, no flight to heaven, no gold, no petrodollar, no attachment. All the attention go do SDR (wich they can manipulate and play this game as they like) and dollar goes into little hidout and then they can do whatever they feel is neccesery.  China is save.

11387,Jeff Snider (Repo Mkt/Eurodollar Expert) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 19 Part 1 of 2,Atlas Integrations,"So, if no one knows how many trillions of dollars are being generated and held by offshore banks/institutions, and if the system (US Dollar) collapses and/or grossly devalues; how does one honestly know how much gold and silver are worth? Think about it... Gold and Silver are considered real forms of money. If most the world&#39;s wealth is measured in US dollars, yet there is an excessive abundance of those US dollars (electronically), what is $100 million super yacht really worth? It is being measured in Funny Money... The scary thing is that most Americans feel confident when making $100K/year... Is that a false notion? I would think so. Lynette Zang pointed out that in 1971, the average family of 4 had a house hold income of $9100/year. This translated into 231 ounces of gold. That gold today would be about $366K/year. It looks like we are 70% poorer on average."

11395,Jeff Snider (Repo Mkt/Eurodollar Expert) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 19 Part 1 of 2,mark hahns,Can anyone explain to me how the lent out 5 dollars stays on Bank A and B and C balance sheet as a liability ? If the money is loaned it&#39;s an Asset of Bank A and a liability of Bank B but if the money is removed from Bank A deposit account how is it still a liability
11396,Jeff Snider (Repo Mkt/Eurodollar Expert) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 19 Part 1 of 2,Ryan Miller Trading Economics,"I think I have a better explanation lol when Bank A lends $5, the $5 is a liability because it owes it to Bank B, but that is also a loan to Bank B which Bank B must pay back, so the loan of that $5 shows up on the asset side of Bank A&#39;s balance sheet. Now, until this $5 is paid back, Bank A still has the loan (debt) as an asset and the $5 that it owes to Bank B as a liability. Now, when Bank B does the same transaction with Bank C. Bank A doesn&#39;t even need to know about this. It has nothing to do with their balance sheet, that&#39;s why it is unaffected."
11397,Jeff Snider (Repo Mkt/Eurodollar Expert) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 19 Part 1 of 2,Ryan Miller Trading Economics,"It&#39;s not removed, Bank A owes Bank B $5. Remember the actual $5 never goes anywhere. So Bank A has a liability of $5 because Bank B received $5 in credit, not the actual $5. Technically Bank B could demand that $5 since a bank deposit is an IOU. Now, Bank B can then take that $5 in electronic money and loan it out to Bank C. Now Bank B also has a liability of $5 owed to Bank C. There are now 3 different claims on the actual $5 that exist at Bank A. Idk if this makes sense lol"

11421,Patrick Ceresna (Big Picture Trading/Macrovoices) RCS Education Ep. 001,Atlas Integrations,"Used to trade FOREX... discovered a little mathematical manipulation of the Martingale Theory which would pay you a little extra for extending the bet, instead of breaking even... Ya, it worked really well (But you had to be willing to go 6 to 7 deep on it). However, you also have to be willing to look at each trade as an individual entity, and accept the fact that some trades were just going to sink to the bottom of the ocean. Overall, you always came out ahead of the game, and quite lucratively. The problem I found in trading is that the markets were not truly organic in behavior. When some power to be decides they want to throw a curve ball, a lot of damage is done, then other powers to be retaliate causing the charts to jump all over the place; and causing EAs to break. Ultimately, too much power to manipulate the markets; the tables are rigged when they have a fit.<br>An example of where the average trader is fighting an uphill battle: The first quantum computer was designed to predict the markets.

In the 60s the interstate system got built and the military pioneered a number of pathbreaking research breakthroughs and innovations. Today hardly any of that happens. There is no major infrastructure project to serve the poor. Every public infrastructure project is bloated and executed inefficiently, a million times slower, and sluggish govt officials pay themselves big money and great pension and healthcare especially in states like CA doing the bare minimum amount of work. This is what makes the Govt struggle to balance the budget even after stealing 50% of productive people&#39;s earnings. I call it stealing because it is as high as 50%! <br>Taxes should be tithes - a tenth, or two tithes - twentieth, may be usury but even three tithes at 30% is fine. But at 50% it is definitely legal theft!<br><br>So it is not the rich taking away from the poor. It is the bloated bureaucrats and their over budget projects and under-delivery robbing the poor non tax-payers and the middle class tax payers.<br><br>The problem today is not just that the beautiful bridge is being built at the cost of unseen jobs, services, products in the private economy. The problem is that a beautiful bridge is being promised but never built, and the bureaucrats are paying themselves to sit at their desks all day taking a lot of money from the private economy with the excuse of building a beautiful bridge, while a crappy bridge gets built at double or triple the cost it needs to be, taking twice or thrice as long to build, or after much paperwork never even sees the light of the day, after spending the $1M! So today you lost the $1M and don&#39;t get to see the bridge or its benefits to the public. Everything is unseen including the beautiful bridge today."

11432,3 Shocking Secrets Trump AND Bernie Are Hiding From YOU!,Bill Jenkins,"The third point is completely wrong - I&#39;ll explain why in THREE simple steps.<br><br>1) No one believes that rich people leave their money in the bank or sit on piles of cash - we all know they buy financial assets.  But almost all the time, they are not buying NEWLY ISSUED assets.  Financial markets are primarily trading in &quot;SECOND-HAND ASSETS&quot;.  If wealth inequality increases then you get greater demand for those assets, and that causes asset price inflation - the &#39;everything bubble&#39; that you quite rightly keep talking about.  Of course, we need all this trading in second-hand assets to create &quot;deep and liquid&quot; asset markets, so that when companies DO want to issue new stocks or bonds there is a market for them.  This was the logic behind QE, but as you rightly point out it was a complete failure at actually helping the economy, but propped up these markets by reinflating the bubble that burst in the GFC.  We need to find a way to have functioning, liquid markets that don&#39;t continually blow up into bubbles.<br><br>2)  But wait a minute, Bill!  Surely businesses are continually reinvesting their profits in productivity, growing the economy?  WRONG!  You haven&#39;t been reading your Pozsar.  The largest companies have been sitting on BILLIONS in retained earnings.  And where do they store these earnings?  That&#39;s right - in financial assets.  Remember step 1 - this does not lead to funding for investment, it just inflates the price of assets.<br><br>But it gets better.  Companies aren&#39;t looking for yield, they just want to keep their cash safe and not lose value.  So they mainly buy US bonds.  So all the money that they keep out of the hands of the US government through crafty tax schemes, the US government ends up borrowing back off them, earning them interest.  The US public PAYS all the big companies to avoid paying their taxes.  You can rant about government deficits, but where would the big corporations store all their cash if the US Government wasn&#39;t helpfully issuing all these bonds?<br>See these two papers from Pozsar for the detail on what the corporations do with their savings: <br><a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2558945"">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2558945</a><br><a href=""https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7bFUL2AD-WEpBrM"">https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7bFUL2AD-WEpBrM</a><br><br>3)  In step number 1 I pointed out that the GFC was a CORRECTION in stock market prices.  In fact, prices didn&#39;t fall nearly far enough to bring them in line with their FUNDAMENTAL VALUE.  The Government bail-out REINFLATED the bubble, and so the current crash is a also a CORRECTION.  <br><br>This wipes out wealth for those who own the shares.  But the whole problem with our current system is that people with wealth try and make money simply by trading on financial markets rather than actually investing money in businesses.  As I pointed out in step number 1, buying assets does not necessarily lead to an increase in investment funding.  The person selling that asset is almost always not going to take the proceeds and spend it on investment, or even spend it on consumption.  He&#39;s just going to buy another asset.  All that endless churn in financial markets inflates prices away from their fundamental value.<br><br>So all those mugs pouring their wealth into asset markets in the last few years might as well have been burning their cash.  They&#39;re just getting what they deserved.  But the problem is that a lot of this wealth was managed on behalf of the public in pension and insurance funds.  And worse still, we need functioning financial markets to have a functioning economy because all businesses need access to credit.<br><br>Therefore, we need to find a way to ensure that surplus wealth (i.e. saving) is always directed towards actual investment in productivity, not increased churn in financial markets leading to asset price bubbles.  I&#39;m not saying I want the government to do it, but we have to recognise that unregulated free markets don&#39;t do this either.  The problem is not just the government and the Fed, it&#39;s all those people (like all your subscribers) who believe they can make money on financial markets instead of doing actual, real, productive work."

11444,3 Shocking Secrets Trump AND Bernie Are Hiding From YOU!,Scott Douglas,a bridge across a river is close to a natural monopoly (illogical to let competition drive down price such as sewers and highways) and a bridge will stimulate economic activity by increasing local business. in short the bridge versus iPhone example is not accurate because the shipping will increase for each iPhone shipped if you had to pay a different way across the river. same can be said for all other trade.

11483,LIVE Q&A,Caleb,"George Gammon You are right I think in this scenario yes it still makes sense to buy now because you will still receive a $50k house for $28k. Almost a 2x return actually. <br><br>In the livestream today with your friend the asset deflation + dollar deflation was brought up but I’m still confused.<br><br>Maybe you can work that into a white board.<br><br>I have funds to invest in real estate but I want to understand most scenarios.  <br><br>However, I think the point you made today in regards to focusing on buying things for cheap is the best approach.

11484,LIVE Q&A,Caleb,George Gammon I’m thinking about this and will prepare a thoughtful response. Thanks for your time.
11485,LIVE Q&A,George Gammon,"Caleb I&#39;m curious how home prices will go from 140k to 50k while at the same time the US will have massive price inflation (dollar collapse)? Also, assuming the dollar does collapse, even if the price of the home went from 140k down to 50k didn&#39;t you still gain purchasing power if you have a 30 fixed rate mortgage?  Example: you put down 20% or 28k, the dollar collapses (therefore so does the value of your mortgage).  In other words, you have a mortgage for 112k and if in 2 years 112k only buys you a loaf of bread, you can pay off your mortgage for the cost of a loaf of bread.  That&#39;s a transfer of purchasing power to the borrower even if the nominal value of the home went down.  <br><br>I appreciate your comment but I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ve thought things through completely?  I&#39;d suggest playing out your scenario using numbers from Venezuela.  You&#39;ll see, if you had a 30 year fixed rate mortgage, you&#39;d still have a net gain in real terms."

11498,LIVE Q&A,allen kimble,"@Caleb My general rule (for now) is to buy calls on GLD or Gold futures(really no difference) 90 days out after it has corrected and consolidated a bit when volatility is cheap. Gold tends to go up in the 3 month intervals. I did this in Mid December.  IMHO i&#39;d stick with ITM calls or slightly out for now. The reason i&#39;d stick with ITM calls is because we aren&#39;t yet in the Bubble phase yet to guarantee you&#39;ll be correct with very far OTM calls. You&#39;ll make around the same amount when VOL is low at this juncture. 5 to 10 baggers are quite normal in this situation.  Once over $2000 which I&#39;d expect to be a 2021 story then far OTM calls are the play.  There is going to be many new never before millionaires made in this upcoming Gold Bubble. Impossible to know how high it goes. I think it at least follows the 1970&#39;s in % gains. For now I expect Gold to climb to around $1735-50 until Mid to late March. I&#39;ll be waiting Thereafter for the next dip,which should arise in MAY(seasonally marks a low), to deploy the next trade to $1923 by August/September 2020.<br><br><br>Yeah, real estate is absolutely INSANE and completely outpacing wage earning gains to keep this up. California is a ticking time bomb. 2007-2012 housing crash can happen again but it will need a big recession along with higher interest rates. Seems very unlikely the fed loses control(JAPAN NEVER DID)so odds are high the USA will have some sort of civil war in the  not so distant future over the Rich/poor and the HUGE income gap the FED is creating.

11514,Marko Whiteboard Finance (Personal Finance Expert) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 018,Ron Randall,"This is the greatest article ever written. The article today, 21 Feb 20 was written by Charles Hugh Smith of <a href=""http://oftwominds.com/"">oftwominds.com</a>. <br>Here are excerpts of his article:<br>One often overlooked characteristic of the current stock market bubble is the extremely small exit for sellers trying to avoid becoming hapless bagholders. Bubbles always present small exits because once sentiment turns, buyers vanish and so price goes over the waterfall and crashes on the rocks below (accompanied by the screams of all the punters who reckoned they&#39;d exit at the top).<br>But modern markets have characteristics which have diminished the exit to a tiny hole in the wall. These include:<br>1. The dominance of index funds. When shares of the index are sold, every constituent stock gets sold. This triggers cascades of selling that overwhelm &quot;buy the dip&quot; buying.<br>2. Computers do most of the trading, and the algorithms are set to follow trends with extreme ferocity. Once the trend is &quot;sell,&quot; the program selling will self-reinforce the cascade.<br>3. Central banks have generated a mesmerizing moral-hazard propaganda field that implicitly suggests &quot;we&#39;ll never stocks go down again, ever!&quot; Yet the only way central banks can causally intervene is to buy stocks directly in size, i.e. in the trillions of dollars. (Recall U.S. stocks are around $35 trillion, global stock markets about $85 trillion. Yes, buying futures contracts through proxies works in stable markets, but not so much in panic cascades of selling.)<br>Beneath the illusory stability, modern markets are extremely illiquid, meaning that when the bubble pops and punters/money managers try to sell, there are no buyers at any price.<br>Liquidity in a crash depends on &quot;buy the dip&quot; bagholders. Once they&#39;ve been destroyed, there are no more buyers at any price. The &quot;buy the dip&quot; crowd will be wiped out after the first spike higher fails, and then nobody will be left who&#39;s willing to catch the falling knife.<br>Hapless bagholders have two options: buy the dip and be destroyed, or hang on hoping for a reversal and be destroyed. Bubbles always burst, and the confidence that &quot;this isn&#39;t a bubble&quot; and &quot;the Fed has our back&quot; are counter-indicators of just how crushing the pop will be: the greater the confidence/euphoria, the greater the crash.<br>All those drunk on &quot;the Fed has our back&quot; punch might want to ponder theFed&#39;s balance sheet: nine weeks of going nowhere:<br>12/25/19 $4.165 trillion<br>1/1/20 $4.173 trillion<br>1/8/20 $4.149 trillion<br>1/15/20 $4.175 trillion<br>1/22/20 $4.145 trillion<br>1/29/20 $4.151 trillion<br>2/5/20 $4.166 trillion<br>2/12/20 $4.182 trillion<br>2/19/20 $4.171 trillion<br>Sober up, people. All bubbles pop, and the higher the extreme, the greater the crash. Only the first sellers will escape; everyone who hesitates or &quot;buys the dip&quot; will be crushed at the bottom of the waterfall."

(Truth Revealed),George Gammon,"NOTE: I didn&#39;t have time to differentiate between any of the &quot;creative&quot; ways banks, financial institutions and hedge funds use the garbage collateral they have.  I mentioned securities lending and rehypothecation but didn&#39;t explain either in the example for the sake of time.  Rehypothecation is where an entity will use collateral that clients are keeping with them as if it were their own. Securities lending is pretty much what it sounds.  And there are limitless other shady ways they can fool the lenders in the repo market to accept collateral that really isn&#39;t theirs.  This is a big reason why there&#39;s plenty of excess reserves, yet the fed still has to intervene.  Hope that makes more sense.  Thx for watching everyone!  ;)"

11650,YOU'LL LOSE MONEY In The Stock Market! (Unless You Do This),Ron Randall,"Below are some excerpts from an article entitled, ‘The Fed has Created a monster bubble It can no longer control’ by Charles Hugh Smith dated 16 Feb 20<br>Bubbles pop when too much risky debt unbacked by collateral is issued to marginal borrowers who inevitably default, triggering massive losses in the financial sector, an equally massive unwind of speculative debt and risky gambles and a deep recession as all the debt-fueled malinvestment dries up and blows away.<br>The 2008 Global Financial Meltdown was the inevitable result of subprime and other debt bubbles bursting which then triggered a panic to unwind trillions of dollars in high-risk speculative gambles in stocks, real estate, junk bonds, etc.<br>The Fed has another problem which it hasn&#39;t been able to solve despite 12 years of trying: to save the financial system from collapse, the Fed has to re-inflate the debt-fueled speculative mania that just popped from unstable excesses of debt, leverage and moral-hazard speculative fever, all piled on a diminishing foundation of actual collateral.<br>The Fed has finally reached the point of no return: either it accepts a painful bursting of the monster moral-hazard bubble it has created or it lets the monster lead the stampede over the cliff to a financial collapse that the Fed can&#39;t rescue with the usual tools of lowering interest rates and bailing out banks. It&#39;s worth recalling that the Fed can&#39;t actually force insolvent lenders to lend more money to insolvent borrowers. After 12 long years of ever-riskier bubble-blowing, the Fed is now boxed in. The Fed will either have to offer false assurances while it attempts an impossible &quot;soft landing&quot;, i.e. a controlled deflation of the Monster Bubble, or it grimly accepts that a 1,000 point decline in the S&amp;P 500 now is a better choice than an implosion later if the Monster Bubble breaks completely free and rampages higher even as the Fed pulls the plug.<br>Moral-Hazard Monster Bubbles cannot be controlled. Human greed guarantees that the Fed will never let stocks fall ever again--ever! will generate self-reinforcing stampedes of speculative mania that no long respond to the signals of the Fed balance sheet."

So now, I have a chamber that restores the body functions that reverses the aging process. And with this real estate knowledge I  will look to buy a small hotel and build out in the rooms these chambers for sleeping in. This system will make the room rentals per night stays at Crazy amounts $300 to $1000 a night. And if I had a nicer location like a windham or Hilton to join with the clients would pay a 10 fold amount. You see that when you wake up in the mornings you will be more rejuvenated and claim the system is like worth $1 million. The dreams are in color, and it puts you into rem sleep in 30 seconds. The most restful sleep on earth. I have been testing this system for 6 years and I&#39;m younger by 20 years. My friends I haven&#39;t seen in 3-40 years are speechless.

11694,Kyle Bass Predicts HSBC Collapse In 2020! (Here's Why),George Gammon,"NOTE: I think Step #2 was a little tough to follow so wanted to explain further/better.  When there&#39;s a peg it&#39;s held in place by HK selling HKD&#39;s if the currency get&#39;s too strong and selling USD if it gets too weak.  If HK has no dollar reserves the peg will break.  <br><br>And capital flight (people selling their HKD denominated assets, exchanging the currency for another currency to reinvest elsewhere) would/will happen for a variety of reasons creating more supply of HKD&#39;s.  At the same time there&#39;s less demand for HKD&#39;s as a result of fewer people taking money out of China to invest in Hong Kong.  Of course less demand and more supply equal a lower value relative to the dollar.  The peg breaks, interest rates go to the moon and the debt laden economy comes crashing down taking HSBC with it.  <br><br>Usually raising rates would help ease the problem because the higher rates attract capital back in creating more demand for HKD&#39;s, but because Hong Kong had to adopt the artificially low interest rates of a country in recession (US 2008 Z.I.R.P.), when it&#39;s economy didn&#39;t need the monetary stimulus, it created asset bubbles like we&#39;ve never seen and a banking system that makes Deutsche Banks derivative book look conservative.

So, what will we do to protect ourselves, to profit from this, if it’s possible and I’ve got to caution you, I believe that we are already entered upon what I called the greater depression. I call it the greater depression because it’s going to be much more serious, much longer lasting and much different than the unpleasantness of 1929 to 1946. So, what do you do?

11814,Doug Casey Reveals Next 10 Bagger Speculation. (1000x UPSIDE!!) 🎯,Dave Bellamy,"@Insolvent Sam I should have said underperformed  but not massively. I was referring to the gradual seemingly ceaseless upward march of the gold to silver ratio. I&#39;m not sure about the actual precise correlation coefficient. Have you got any good numerical data on this? I mean there is short term and long term. Gold in a bull market = silver in a bull market in 1970-1980 and 1999-2011. That hints at a positive correlation but not a coefficient of 1 0, maybe 0.9 or 0.5, unlikely to be zero or negative surely? Of course if the Au:Ag ratio was constant, the correlation would be 1. I take your point though. I will go and see if I can find Rick Rule&#39;s comments."
11815,Doug Casey Reveals Next 10 Bagger Speculation. (1000x UPSIDE!!) 🎯,Insolvent Sam,"@Dave Bellamy it hasn&#39;t &quot;massively underperformed gold&quot; because there has never (recent couple of hundred years) been any correlation between the two PMs.  Rick Rule explains this well in his numerous videos.  It&#39;s a psychological thing that people have, claiming that the silver price is tied to the gold price somehow, so if gold goes up but silver doesn&#39;t, then you should pour all your life savings into silver while it&#39;s &quot;super cheap&quot; because you&#39;re going to become a billionaire &quot;when&quot; it goes up to &quot;match&quot; gold.  It&#39;s complete nonsense.  Just pull up any silver and gold price charts for the past 100 years and overlay them on each other and it&#39;s clear as day that there has never been any correlation.  Their uses are completely different and unsurprisingly this means that their price moves independently of each other.  I cannot begin to imagine the utter pandemonium in the silver stacker community if/when gold reaches $2k+ but silver remains at $18.  They will be buying up the &quot;insanely cheap&quot; silver as fast as they can back up their trucks, ready to become billionaires &quot;when&quot; the price suddenly shoots to the moon at $200.  History tells us that is never going to happern but like all the silver pundits have been saying for the past 20+ years, &quot;this time it&#39;s different&quot;.  <b>sigh</b>"

11837,Tesla Stock: Should You Buy? (My Best Investment Advice Ever),Luca Jako,"@vrosca For the P/L I use ATHs and ATLs, respectively, when it can make sense. For the probabilities, it&#39;s subjective. If after all fundamental research I don&#39;t find anything convincing in either direction, 50-50 will do the job. But I prefer to enter investments that are at least 60-40, although these numbers are subjective. A way to consider this in the wager size, is to multiply it by the percentage of successful previous bets/investments. Provided the strategy remains the same. This way if the strategy is flawed, e.g. probabilities are estimated bad, the wager size diminishes in size. This unfortunately works out only with frequents bets though..."

11858,Tesla Stock: Should You Buy? (My Best Investment Advice Ever),Forest Pepper,"While the &quot;Kelly Criteria&quot; works great for a game like BlackJack, where the probabilities are known precisely, I&#39;m not sure it is so helpful for investing.  The game of BlackJack is a well behaved random process; the occurrence of various card combinations corresponds well with the statistical model.  The Stock Market is much wilder than a game like BlackJack.  Human emotions, politics, and competing companies all influence how a particular stock may behave.  Any probabilities computed for a stock, in order to apply the &quot;Kelly Criteria&quot;, can only be educated guesses.  Unless you are God, your estimate of those probabilities will change from week to week, perhaps even from day to day, with all the craziness going on in the world.  <br>Another way to invest is to use your intuitive understanding of the world, that you have built up through years of experience [i.e., observing how the world works].  Do you think a company is offering a product that will be popular?  Is the company in good financial shape?

11862,Zerohedge BAN! Coronavirus! Tesla! Chris Irons (QTR) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 012,donnie gebert,"Murray Rothbard’s For a New Liberty. on yelling fire in the movie theater:<br>“Consider, for example, the classic example where liberals generally concede that a person’s “right of freedom of speech” must be curbed in the name of the “public interest”: Justice Holmes’ famous dictum that no one has the right to cry “fire” falsely in a crowded theater. Holmes and his followers have used this illustration again and again to prove the supposed necessity for all rights to be relative and tentative rather than precise and absolute.<br>But the problem here is not that rights cannot be pushed too far but that the whole case is discussed in terms of a vague and wooly “freedom of speech” rather than in terms of the rights of private property.<br>Suppose we analyze the problem under the aspect of property rights. The fellow who brings on a riot by falsely shouting “fire” in a crowded theater is, necessarily, either the owner of the theater (or the owner’s agent) or a paying patron. If he is the owner, then he has committed fraud on his customers. He has taken their money in exchange for a promise to put on a movie or play, and now, instead, he disrupts the show by falsely shouting “fire” and breaking up the performance. He has thus welshed on his contractual obligation and has thereby stolen the property—the money—of his patrons and has violated their property rights.<br>Suppose on the other hand, that the shouter is a patron and not the owner. In that case, he is violating the property right of the owner—as well as of the other guests to their paid for performance. As a guest, he has gained access to the property on certain terms, including an obligation not to violate the owner’s property or to disrupt the performance the owner is putting on. His malicious act, therefore, violates the property rights of the theater owner and of all the other patrons.<br>There is no need, therefore, for individual rights to be restricted in the case of the false shouter of “fire.” The rights of the individual are still absolute; but they are property rights. The fellow who maliciously cried “fire” in a crowded theater is indeed a criminal, but not because his so-called “right of free speech” must be pragmatically restricted on behalf of the “public good”; he is a criminal because he has clearly and obviously violated the property rights of another person.”"

FED wise, they are stupidly attempting to printing the way out of the Pandemic with ZERO chance of making it work. We continue  to go further in a downward spiral and it is only a matter of time before the depression will be so great that I see in the remaining of my life will not get out of it.

11873,Zerohedge BAN! Coronavirus! Tesla! Chris Irons (QTR) Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 012,Cruising Off Duty,"I found your channel from listening to the Quote the Raven Podcast and I am so glad he brought your channel to my attention.  I have been binge-watching all of your past episodes.  I really like your whiteboard episodes as you boil down financial topics that may seem very complicated in such an easy to follow way.  I also like the detailed interview with Rick Rule.  I have been telling friends, family and co-workers that this massive bubble will burst at some point in the not too distant future and you should be ready.  My wife and I personally have been getting prepared by heavily investing in some physical silver and many gold exploration, production and royalty companies.  We have a youtube channel that is sailing focussed we have made it clear that we plan to retire, liquidate everything and live full time sailing the world until we are too old to sail.  The channel has a decent level of views and subscribers as many people seem interested in living full time and travelling the world by sailboat.  Part of this ongoing theme of our channel of retiring to a sailing life, leads us easily into a topic of saying that when you have all of your net worth in your house and the stock market and you feel like you are rich because of this record-long bull market, that you may want to get some insurance by getting 10% of your investable net worth in Precious metals and/or gold and silver producing stocks.  Therefore I was thinking that it was time for us to publically warn our viewers about the coming deep recession or depression and tell them what we are doing to get some insurance that may pay off very well if this deep recession that we expect, does come true.  I don&#39;t really think it is a case of IF but WHEN.  Instead of me going into great detail into all the reasons why I believe there is a huge recession/depression coming I think I will keep it short and sweet and just point all my viewers to start checking out your channel for the reasons.  You say it so well and so succinctly that I couldn&#39;t do it any better and then I will just tell them what we are doing to prepare and how they may affect our plan to sell everything and live full time on a sailing catamaran.  I am thinking that when I mention your channel I may throw a short clip (maybe 20-30 second clip) of some episode where you made some excellent points to give them a small taste of your excellent presentation of complex topics.  Let me know if you would be ok with this.  You can reach me at Craig@<a href=""http://cruisingoffduty.com/"">CruisingOffDuty.com</a>.  Thanks for putting out such great content that so easy explain complex topics.  Keep up the great work!  Craig"

From nano silver mouthwash, nano silver face scrubbers, nano silver socks and underwear, there&#39;s new products every year that is taking permanently off the market and away from investors. The idea that someone at the garbage company can sniff out nano silver is ludicrous. So unlike gold that is hoarded, silver is going to end up in the landfill too small to recover. Silver would have to surpass gold in price by many factors for the market to even entertain the idea of mining for silver in landfills one nano silver sock at a time. Silver could even become extinct if the demand continues at the present pace, but most likely it will be at  a greater pace with the wide adoption of EV which uses silver more."

Let&#39;s hope it happens soon so the smart money can back up the truck on this deal. When the King Dollar then undergoes it&#39;s on Massive QE then gold will go up. So there&#39;s going to be a big deflation on the horizon which dovetails the first Great Recession or Depression since the Great Recession of 09. In the End Game of King Dollar, one does not spend gold for fiat dollars, they just purchase goods and services directly. Can you imagine being prudent for the last 4 decades holding gold and then selling it for paper fiat in the morning and spending the day running around like a headless chicken trying to spend all that fiat before it expires by dinner?"

12001,How Gold Standard Creates A BOOMING ECONOMY! (Must Watch),TrackingWidgets,"George, what drugs are you on? Even from the point of view of simple arithmetic the only way prices go down is through lower cost of raw materials (isn&#39;t going to happen over time unless the raw materials are growing in supply without added cost), lower cost of labour (increase in poverty), automation (fewer jobs, more poverty), or any other method that may increase production without a rise in cost. GDP isn&#39;t a relevant measure because it doesn&#39;t include the health of individuals or families within the economy.<br><br>I didn&#39;t recognize your face, thought perhaps you were Darrin Stephens and you had your own Samantha... but no, you&#39;re in real estate. I&#39;m guessing when you talk about prices going down you weren&#39;t referring to real estate...?  Quoting from one article on housing prices, it reads &quot;Between 1890 and 2012, U.S. house prices increased by 150 percent in real terms. Prices rose 1.8 percent per year on average until World War I, contracted during the war, but recovered during the interwar period. However, the extent of the price appreciation in the interwar period continues to be debated. While the Grebler et al. (1956)-Shiller (2009)-hybrid index suggests a substantial recovery of real house prices during the 1930s, a competing series by Fishback and Kollmann (2012) shows that during the Great Depression house prices fell back to their early 1920s level.&quot;<br><br>Certainly a fiat currency needs limiting factors, but its use is not what causes problems. Distribution of currency, where in the cycle it is introduced, the velocity of it once in circulation - all of these affect the economy regardless of the method of backing it. A more useful method of backing a fiat currency may be found in the population count within the country of currency creation, along with the value of natural, renewable resources.<br><br>Exactly what prices were dropping that you figure would have continued to drop/depreciate year after year, essentially until what, everything would be free? Yes, there is depreciation that happens, mostly in the purchase of new technology, where something depreciates to no value at all within a 3 to 5 year &quot;life&quot; now. I hardly see how that helps anyone but the companies manufacturing the new technology that obsoletes the existing technology..."

Spain experienced such inflation when they were draining their colonies of all gold and other precious metals and bringing them back to the home country. Another thing that can inflate the gold based monetary system is more efficient mining, or governments dumping all their gold in favor of something else (creating a huge surplus in the market and nose diving the price).<br><br>edit: Another negative side effect of using a metal for money is that the metal is effectively too expensive for use in industry, even in cases where it is best suited for the job.<br><br>I agree that the gold standard is better, but what do you think about keeping a fixed fiat system and making it expandable or contractable ONLY by constitutional convention?<br><br>Thanks again for what you do."

(Shocking Insights Revealed),Brian,"You cut across alot of topics here a bit too quickly. &quot;<a href=""http://wtfhappenedin1971.com/"">WTFhappenedin1971.com</a>&quot; is a website with alot of graphs designed to look official and present as evidence, but without an informed assessment each of the graphs means nothing. For example the graph showing black income as a percentage of whites starts in 1948. Are you suggesting that the impact on leaving the gold standard was immediately more measurable on black income than, say, the gains made by the civil rights act signed in 1964? Furthermore, remove the top earners (top 1% and bottom 1%) from the data and let&#39;s see what that graph looks like. Generally speaking, almost none of the graphs stretch back far enough to give a perspective on the data - i.e. 1900 onwards. If they did, it would show that the US government debt to GDP ratio is lower now than it was after WW2. Additionally, inflation has been taking place long before 1971. While deflation also took place, overall, the trend favoured inflation. You can check the data here: <br><br><a href=""https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi"">https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi</a><br><br>To help me understand, why is 1971 so significant?

Zero Interest Rates Policy to have the federal reserve drop interest rates to 0 for 10 to 12 years (this creates a massive problem for pension funds)<br>Step 3: Pension funds can no longer get a 7% return so they look to the corporate bond market<br>Step 4: Cause and effect, corporations now have lower borrowing costs, taking corporate debt to all time highs<br><br>Step 5: Corporations use pension funds, your money, our money to buy back shares with debt.<br><br>Step 6: The entire stock market blows up to bubble levels due to repurchasing of shares<br><br>Step 7: Companies that are too big to fail gain 100% profits not based on fundamentals while shorters get rekted as fucked!!<br>This happened in February 2020 and then, flash crash<br><br>Step 8: The real economy is affected as people enter a golden age of temporary abundance due to low interest rates and cheap debt, feeling rich, getting loans and spending more causing the wealth effect<br>The gaslighting was insane, people shopped for basic needs and stored up on food due to covid-19 quarantines<br>Step 9: Housing market booms as a result of the wealth effect!<br>(This happened last year)<br>Step 10: The entire economy is predicated upon the repo market being able to keep short term interest rates in check as government has everything under control as unsustainable hundreds of trillions are printed as both dollar and oil dependency come to centuries old final decay<br>Step 11: By keeping short term interest rates low also allows the government to roll over trillions of dollars in debt until the next presidential term. Sell everything here before it&#39;s too late. Keep your physical cash in local currency, watch out for any updates on a possible arms race to war and or the introduction of Central Bank Based Digital Currency.

If UBI empowers individuals to make better choices of who is awarded their income then I&#39;d expect to see the corporations which provide true value to get a greater portion of any individual&#39;s income.  It is difficult to reconcile this with inflation, but I don&#39;t see trickle down working, so let&#39;s try trickle up, and let companies compete for the average Joe&#39;s dollar.

And in some sense this would be a bit more of a fairer system than we presently have [ I need to stress that I am opposed to both the present system and any UBI] because the consumer would see inflation in goods and services and would know the government is overspending. And it it would be a lot cheaper to service than the present system because all those programs need employees to administer them.

It is my understanding that any member banks could borrow at the Fed discount window and the Fed would effectively be backstopping the rate spike in other markets. The REPO market has lots of participants that do not have access to the direct borrowing at Fed discount window. I think this is why the REPO rates exploded in September while the effective fed fund rate remained almost unchanged. It makes no sense to me that this spike would have affected all markets if the Fed would not have intervened. I also believe that the REPO rate spike was mostly linked to a liquidity risk. Although the collateral pledged for REPO is normally a quality low risk government bond, it could become extremely difficult for market participants to liquidate their collateral positions without drastically affecting prices in the case of a counterparty default."

Do you think something is happening with assets that we don&#39;t know about?"
12178,Repo Market Greatest Hits Timeline: Discover How It's Getting Worse!,Bill Schlafly,"I&#39;m C- so help me if I take a misstep and give me feedback if I am on the right track.  So the purpose of bankers borrowing and lending money over night is to meet cash reserve standards that are set by the Fed as a means to keep banks from lending too much money.  These rules legitimize the system by keeping the money supply in check. In good times over night lending is easy money for banks that have plenty of cash and a slap on the wrist for a bank that has over-loaned its cash reserves. <br><br><br><br>For reasons that may become clear some day soon, banks began charging higher and higher rates indicating some banks have become less inclined to loan cash even for a single night.  The Fed, ignoring its own regulations, rather than bankrupting the bank, provides the cash needed to prevent insolvency.<br><br><br>Questions:  What are the cash rich banks afraid of or have they conspired together to target something in particular?  I&#39;ll leave the tinfoil hat off for now and assume they don&#39;t trust the bonds as collateral because China.<br><br><br><br>And now I step onto much less firm ground by claiming that there are probably powerful insiders using this cash to fuel the stock market bubble because cash sucks as an investment and gold would be too obvious a play and cause widespread panic.  Pumping stock prices up while printing cash should result in a nice inflation bubble and might conceal the actual crash.<br><br><br>And then we get to watch the oblivious broke middle class try to fight their way back from the bottom....yet again.  Rinse and repeat.  Brilliant!  Wait a minute, I&#39;m middle class (sort of)!  I&#39;m half cash so I&#39;ll keep some popcorn on hand.  5 decades from now old people will say silly stuff like, I remember when bread was only $2.50 a loaf, heh heh, and cars were fueled by liquid called gasoline...while their teeth fall out."

12212,Repo Market Bailout: TERRIFYING Unintended Consequences Revealed!,George Gammon,"CORRECTION: Upon further review the 10 year rate did NOT go up when fed started expanding their B/S with repo.  It went up a few days before (Maybe traders had inside info?? But who knows).  The chart I looked at was inaccurate.  To be clear, 10 year rates went up during past QE, just not on Sept. 17th when the repo mkt blew up.  In a way this makes sense because repos aren&#39;t supposed to expand the BS, the loan from the fed is supposed to be paid back at end of term.  Market most likely viewed the first repo operations more like Operation Twist (didn&#39;t expand BS) and less like QE (did expand BS).  Thx for watching everyone! ;)"
12213,Repo Market Bailout: TERRIFYING Unintended Consequences Revealed!,Kevin Walsh,Thanks for another great video George. I never followed the repo market before but when I heard interest rates shot up to 10% and the Fed intervened I knew there was something fishy going on. Then when I heard it was another endless bailout in disguise I knew this would lead to trouble. And I&#39;m not even an economist or financial expert! It just didn&#39;t pass the smell test. I&#39;m glad I live in Indonesia because when the collapse comes we&#39;ll still have plenty of rice to eat.
12214,Repo Market Bailout: TERRIFYING Unintended Consequences Revealed!,George Gammon,@Messi19 You&#39;re connecting the dots very well.  The Fed creates tremendous moral hazard.
12215,Repo Market Bailout: TERRIFYING Unintended Consequences Revealed!,George Gammon,"@Messi19 This is a fantastic question.  Let me do my best to explain.  <br><br><br>When I&#39;m referring to the repo market and I say the fed &quot;buys&quot; bonds, I&#39;m using that synonymously with accepting collateral.<br><br><br>Jeff Snider outlined how the &quot;Repurchase&quot; agreements (while they are supposed to be a purchase) are nothing more than a collateralized loan.  To make matters worse, the collateral doesn&#39;t actually change hands.  So is it a loan or is it a purchase??  Who knows! <br><br><br>That&#39;s why I go back and forth referring to repos as loans/purchases.  I think this breeds confusion so I&#39;ll work on that moving forward.  <br><br><br>As far as the process of paying for the bonds (or loaning the money how ever you prefer to look at it), all big banks have accounts with the Fed where their reserves are held.  When a repo is done (or any asset purchase from a big bank) the Fed simply credits the borrower/seller reserve account that xyz bank has with the Fed.  <br><br><br>Whatever amount they credit xyz banks reserve account is NEW MONEY that didn&#39;t exist before.  We call this &quot;money printing.&quot;  The Fed isn&#39;t literally printing green pieces of paper, or even writing a check, they&#39;re just typing digits into an account.  (Like a score keeper changing the score at a basketball game when a team scores.) <br><br><br>Hopefully that makes more sense.<br><br><br>It gets even crazier but I&#39;ll let that soak in before I confuse you any more! haha ;)"

Then where do all the &quot;Physically REPO&#39;d vehicles go to and why is the car market just chugging along as if it were a walk-in-the-park? <br><br>Real Estate Investment Trusts were created to act like the buyers that we never see. This sustains the false image that Real Estate Agencies prop up to keep the false public illusion alive which portrays a &quot;Stable Housing Market&quot;.

12222,Repo Market Bailout: TERRIFYING Unintended Consequences Revealed!,paco2ski,Repo  to 10% was actually only 3% of borrowed funds..   somethig like 80% was absorbed at 5%  -- LOWEST  quality collateral and  late in day people got hurt.. but if it&#39;s only 1 day.. not crushing blow..

By making it illegal, there should be less of it around and less chance of more people getting addicted. The addiction gets so strong people really get hooked up and loose their liberty of free choice. (Ever heard about peoples drinks getting spiked?) <br>You should try finding some video&#39;s on youtube about this. I&#39;m sure there will be enough material.<br>Therefore, since it takes away free choice (people go into rehab centers for months if not years), are you really convinced that freely allowing drugs would be a good thing?

But if you owe $100 million dollars, the bank has the problem. They’re forced to work with you when you have challenges. That’s a good use of leverage to create the financial incentive for the lender to work with you."

12292,Jason Hartman (REAL ESTATE EXPERT): The Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 009!,alan grobmeier,"George, this is REALLY misleading.  Although &#39;refi till you die&#39; does work, you have this little &#39;pesky&#39; problem of interest tracing.  You can&#39;t just equity strip a property and put the money in your pocket.  You have to put it SOMEWHERE and that return has to be greater than the interest your are paying in order to be allowed.  Otherwise you are paying a higher mortgage &amp; paying tax on what is being held in a &#39;safe&#39; CD.<br><br>For example:  If I take $100k out of a property, I have to TRACE where that $100k goes or my interest will not be allowed by the IRS.  If I take the $100k &amp; put it as a down on a $300k property, no problem.  But if I SIT on the cash, waiting for a RE downturn, the IRS will disallow the interest until it is deployed.<br><br>It&#39;s NOT &#39;free money&#39; like Jason Hartman is claiming!"

Since 1980 the GDP has grown by approx 20% per FTE while salaries are constant.    Salaries per GDP shrink from 48% 2000 to  43% today<br>If you assume higher inflation then CPI and higher unemployment it becomes even worth.  As US GDP is consumer driven the difference need to come from credits.  <br><br><br>When starting a broader global look then we have an oversupply in commodities, production and labor.  All this drives down prices and keeping inflation down.  However, the S&amp;P 500 companies making approx 60% of their revenue overseas specially in the strong growing countries (Jim Richards).  <br><br><br> In parallel the workforce getting older and need to life from their savings mainly stock market or pensions funds.  In an recessions stocks should decline and mainly for a long time.  Pumping money in the system helps that people don&#39;t get a  recession shock with declining stock markets.

12315,Recession Watch: Terrifying New Data Uncovered! (BE PREPARED),positive economic reform ideas.,"Unemployment set to be a problem that forces Universal Income or the system unravels as business goes bankrupt with no customer base. The jobs are being done by soft and hard tech because that is cost saving to businesses in the longer run than is paying wages to people who are a good deal more unreliable and twice as slow at least in any case. A business or company is a profit vehicle at law, not a beneficiary that owes people <a href=""http://jobs.top/"">jobs.Top</a>  Shareholders can even sue management if they believe they make decisions that mean slack profits. Of course, they could just go straight to government to buy the end product en masse from them at prices they prefer which would leave consumers obsolete.

12320,Recession Watch: Terrifying New Data Uncovered! (BE PREPARED),Michael Klein,"I am convinced we are well past the Recession point and have been in a Depression since February 2020. Covid is the unexpected variable that has sent us further into likely a depression worse than the 1928 one. Because of Covid, when we come out is very much unknown. Even IF there is a reliable vaccine, it is ONLY a vaccine and we will unlikely ever get a CURE since this a similar to the flu, and common cold. Both are Coronoviruses and to date we only have a questionable vaccine for the Flu and no vaccine for the common cold. This virus as a respiratory virus is much worse and if you asked any survivor, then pretty much say the same thing, that it takes longer to &#39;recover&#39;. This causes survivors missing even more work as health and food costs continue to inflate at alarming rates. I do not see a clear path to come of what we are currently in. The Gov&#39;t and FED cannot feed enough currency to ease this."

12350,The Real Reason They Want To BAN CASH! (Shocking Insights Revealed),George Gammon,"NOTE: Further explanation, banks create new money when they lend.  But the new money has to be backed up by reserves (even if there&#39;s no reserve requirement ie Britain).  The banks aren&#39;t actually using deposits to lend, which is why you hear people talk about banks being able to lend even without deposits.  Reserves are now kept at the Fed and just moved from one banks reserve account to another banks reserve account.  The money never get&#39;s into the real economy unless the additional reserves prompt additional lending.  <br><br><br>Also, To be clear I&#39;m presenting Richard Werners views and adding my own commentary.  I&#39;m not saying I think this is the plan of the central banks, although it&#39;s in interesting argument Werner makes.  I definitely think there&#39;s a chance he&#39;s right.  I also think there&#39;s a good chance this end game plays out even if it isn&#39;t the Fed&#39;s plan, the digital currency will be pushed by governments as well IMO.  Werner sees the central banks as bad guys and governments as more benevolent (although still bad), I see it the opposite way.  Thx for watching everyone! ;)"

12352,The Real Reason They Want To BAN CASH! (Shocking Insights Revealed),River's Edge Goat Dairy,"The fact that the money reserve is &quot;held&quot; by the Federal Reserve is perhaps the only reason why we have not fallen to hyper inflation. Though, this begs the question. How much money printing can occur? And when (not if) will inflation become a problem, where by interest rates go up? Negative rates is temporary? Will the interest rates go up to + 5% ever again? I believe the answer is .... YES!  When interest rates go up, this will create an environment no one &#39;Wants&#39; to consider. I believe this would make a great discussion amongst, Richards, Schiff Gammon? Interest rates or a real rate of return will be the meat and potatoes to a &#39;recovery&#39;..... Until the rate hikes.

12375,Repo Market: Discover New Insider Secrets (THIS WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!),George Gammon,NOTE:  Want to be clear on why I&#39;m referring to the end game as Triffin&#39;s Paradox 2.0.  Triffins Paradox basically says the country with the reserve currency will have to print too much money (to supply the world) and this will lead to the inevitable decline of the currency and loss of reserve status.  The connection is the US now has to prop up the system by providing the collateral the world needs (treasuries) which will have the same net result of Triffins paradox (decline and loss of reserve currency).  That&#39;s why I&#39;m calling it Triffins Paradox 2.0...hope that makes sense.  Thx for watching everyone! ;)

Was it only in Sep/19 that primary dealers stopped accepting bad collaterals? Did QT help saturate the market with bad collaterals?<br><br>And that&#39;s why Fed is considering to give money directly to the Hedge Fund? The problem is not in the primary dealers.

Europe for example or any other country where medicine is at high level. Paper (name of university) almost does not matter, knowledge matters!! And it is a huge difference if you have university education for 500K or 20-30K (in Latvia, probably about 60-80K in some other country as France or Great Britain). Get your education outside America and then go back and earn money. And there is no language barrier in Great Britain too for Americans..."

The downside is that Bitcoin holders actively supporting it have to put up their private keys into a &quot;hot&quot; LN node connected to the internet so transactions are capped to the most BTC those nodes have access to AND (once the current crop of volunteers gets wiped out by hackers) LN transactions will carry transaction fees to cover the hacking risks and OpSec costs of running an LN node.

If they make it illegal it won&#39;t be going very high and won&#39;t be worth having. People thinking it will succeed even if the Governments are against it are delusional. If businesses are not allowed to accept Bitcoin how are you going to spend it for anything much. How is BTC decentralised when China controls it via its domination of the mining.

We were involved in Syria basically fighting Assad who was fighting ISIS by using the SDF ( Syrian democratic forces). That&#39;s the new formula post 2007. I don&#39;t think the economic data from the past two applies because I don&#39;t think that the situations are comparable

Pool money together by doing deals with friends, be enterprising. Refinance the properties to buy more and familiarize yourself with our modern lending system because it&#39;s usually changing. I personally have access to the VA where there&#39;s a very special benefit allowing me to buy a investment property up to four units and assume the rental income before the financing goes into escrow. Keep your head on a swivel and always look out for deals. Most important surround yourself with like minded people and never spend to much time with losers."

12498,"Brent Johnson: Expert Reveals Shocking Predictions! (Gold, Inflation, USD, Stocks)",Trace Farley,"George Gammon I’m really enjoying your videos George. What about the idea of a video on investing overseas right now? Specifically where the dollar is super strong in places like Colombia or others. When the dollar comes crashing down over the next five or 10 years, as you mentioned, those investments would increase dramatically. With asset prices so high in the US right now, perhaps this is the best place to invest"
12499,"Brent Johnson: Expert Reveals Shocking Predictions! (Gold, Inflation, USD, Stocks)",Filipe Moreira,"I&#39;m from Brazil and we are, in deed, experiencing a dollar bull market. And my guess is that those Emerging Markets Central Banks are buying US Treasuries as a hegde to all this. So, we have another problem, which is: there is a flow, not so much into to the fx market dollars as a mean to roll over those dept, but as a way to access theses T-Bills, competing now, and much more in the future, with mutual funds and hegde fund for that type of asset. That will surely lead the US Yield to negative territory this time. Which means the hyperbubble is formating on the Nasdaq, but after the defaults starts popping up in to the game, the bubble will deslocate itself further into the T-Bills, and only after the intervention of the FED into the FX market plus  helicopter money (because now we are saying that the Financial engenering is containing all capital flows and blocking them to go into the real economy and into the FX markets) than, it&#39;s the end game for the dollar. Until then, the Emerging Markets are gonna have a real hard time. And that&#39;s what i think Rogers is all about. You see, the FED never understood itself as an US Central Bank more than as a &quot;world&#39;s central bank&quot;, and that&#39;s why they are going to try saving the world, and end up by dooming the dollar instead."

12511,"Brent Johnson: Expert Reveals Shocking Predictions! (Gold, Inflation, USD, Stocks)",Market Barometrix,Interesting to look at this nearly a year later.  The Fed has since printed trillions of dollars and pumped them into the financial economy.  Yet those funds aren&#39;t really making it into the real economy.  Velocity of Money stagnating.  Dollar weakness in the FX market.  How can we interpret the current situation.  I&#39;m convinced of the eventuality of a dollar collapse.  But really trying to understand if we can expect a dollar bubble before the eventual collapse or if it just continues down.

12572,LIVE Q&A (special guest: Real Estate Expert JASON HARTMAN!) 😉,Paul Schuyler,"There&#39;s another really interesting implication of low vs. high liquidity in property markets:  property durability and uniqueness.  I&#39;m not speaking about finances per se but rather about lifestyle.  My profession is Architect, in several US states and in one Latin American country.  One becomes an Architect specifically to create memorable, unique places.  America is inferior to many other countries in terms of the quality and diversity of its Architecture.  I say this for the exact reasons they pointed out...high liquidity and easy financing creates an incentive to buy and sell properties more frequently.  As a result, there&#39;s a powerful designer and builder incentive to create properties that are more generic.  Properties that are more easily marketable.  People are afraid to create &#39;uniqueness&#39; in their environment in the USA because it can impact the resale value.  As any broker will tell you, some property improvements can be good investments(redone kitchens, baths, etc.), and others are a bad idea (pools, unique colors, custom elements, etc).   Properties in the USA are more like fluid financial instruments vs. properties overseas.   When there are rare and unique properties in the USA they&#39;re not listed on the regular MLS.  Instead they&#39;re sold like pieces of art via auction houses like Sotheby&#39;s.

Most other areas nearby are over $200,000 for a 3/2 house with minimum 1300 sf. Our area involves a 1/2 hour commute to major population centers / job centers. Vacant building lots (1/4 acre) are selling for $5995 - with owner financing available ($500 down - $110/month).

12583,LIVE Q&A (special guest: Real Estate Expert JASON HARTMAN!) 😉,Herb Levin,"Low Rates- To me, The artificially low rates produced artificially high prices on the opposite side of the scale. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but time will tell.<br><br>In Sarasota, rents dropped 40 to 50%  in 07 to 2012.   Investors gave back huge swatches of property, especially and in rough areas.  Jobs losses, lack of full time jobs etc help drive prices down.  Only because bail outs, QE 1,2 and twist plus who knows what they did covertly, made prices into this bubble we have again.<br> Pensions will get cut, 401ks etc and most boomers will have to sell thier second and 3rd homes and probably down size.  I see a huge shift coming.  <br>Peter Schiff brought up the point that properties were never allowed to fully adjust to thier bottom. And since they were so artificially inflated again, they will drop further this time."
12584,LIVE Q&A (special guest: Real Estate Expert JASON HARTMAN!) 😉,Herb Levin,"@Marie  The low rates have greatly forced up asset prices already along with quantitative easing money injections.  If rates go up then properties and stocks go down and so do bonds!  Does this make sense?<br>We need real market rates of interest again so we can get return for our savings.  By forcing rates down for a decade, they have raped the savers and producers to bail out the spenders and speculators.  Horrible if you ask me.  Really they can not allow rates to rise at all or the bond market goes belly up, the stock market crashes and properties fall off a cliff and the U.S debt payments go through the roof. <br>Ad Danielle Dimartino who worked at the FED just recently stated- Pensions are toast!   <br>Its criminal what they have done sadly."

12599,Jason Hartman (ARE YOU TAKING ON TOO MUCH RISK?): The Rebel Capitalist Show Ep. 006!,happy bubbles,"I am an appraiser for an assessor&#39;s office in California, the tax collector is not the entity that calculates the land and improvement value, it is the assessor that calculates that value. The assessor calculates the value, then sends the information to the tax collector to generate the bill. All the tax collector does is collect the taxes. I know this is kind of nitpicky, but I talk to frustrated taxpayers all the time who are irritated that they have to contact multiple agencies before they finally talk to the person who can answer their questions. Bottom line, if you want to know how the value of your property was calculated, call the assessor&#39;s office and speak with the appraiser who appraised your property."

Every one of their engineered crises is a heist, an intentional crime.

(MUST SEE),George Gammon,"NOTE:  When looking at their derivatives book I&#39;m making some assumptions based on the limited info out there, my research and some good ole fashioned common sense.  As an example, it&#39;s not completely clear if DB is the actually the CCP or a CCP broker.  Because the value on the CCP line item is so much lower relative to the notional value (compared to the bilaterals) it would lead you to believe they weren&#39;t a main party involved.  That said, DB isn&#39;t listed on any 3rd party sites for CCP&#39;s?  I&#39;d guess they&#39;re their own CCP via a subsidiary, but I don&#39;t know that 100%.

12791,Christina Brown (My Real Estate Agent): The REBEL CAPITALIST SHOW Ep. 004!,George Gammon,@Kevin Belcher I just think they&#39;re different.  Maybe it&#39;s easiest for me to think about them in that way?  One is an investment and one is insurance.
12792,Christina Brown (My Real Estate Agent): The REBEL CAPITALIST SHOW Ep. 004!,Kevin Belcher,"@George Gammon George is right. I know a lot of older timers that had rentals, and they ALL REGET selling the business. Rents ALWAYS keep up with inflation, because everyone needs a roof over their head. In my  opinion, real estate is just as safe as precious metals."

We did not set a &#39;New Normal&#39; we just adapted. So George and Chris, we got a &#39;plague&#39; and we can see so clearly how the FED jockeys too much and U.S. Gov&#39;t is not wanting to stay out of things. With this current president, he will not stay out of things and he was totally unprepared how it would impact the U.S. IF we had Hillary it may be somewhat worse and if Biden wins in November, He will be overwhelmed and as Rickards said in Jekyll Island, Get back on the Gold Standard, Get rid of the FED and get rid of the IRS."

12842,LIVE Q&A,tortoise62,"Perhaps you could share this with your listeners.  The difference between gold and bitcoin is that bitcoin has recurring expenses.  Gold, once mined and purchased has no additional costs.  <br><br>Take a look at what a mining company pays to continue mining.  <a href=""https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-mining/cloud-mining/genesis-mining/"">https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-mining/cloud-mining/genesis-mining/</a><br>These costs make transactional bitcoin inefficient.  <br><br>I contend most people are in love with the idea of a currency outside the influence of central bankers.  Even if bitcoin had no transactional costs, it would not be outside governmental influence.  In the US, the IRS has declared cryptos to be commodity.  This means they take their bite out of you when you use it to transact.  You have the burden of keeping records of its basis.  The only pro of bitcoin is the ability to evade capital controls when crossing borders."

12865,Jason Hartman Part 3: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),George Gammon,"NOTE: Traveling today so don’t have time to reply to many comments.  If you haven’t watched parts 1 and 2 please know Jason and I are NOT suggesting you should run out and buy real estate.  Most markets are in a huge bubble and way overpriced.  BUT, real estate is local and there are certain areas where a starter home, in a good area, can still be purchased under the cost of construction with an RV ratio over 1% (monthly gross rent 1%+ of purchase price).  Remember the real estate mkt is extremely inefficient so you can still buy “cheap” properties when the market, as a whole, is expensive.  Lastly, when you buy a rental prop you’re buying an income stream backed by a hard asset.  If you look at it in those terms, instead of buying an asset that just goes up or down in price, I think it’ll make more sense. 😉👍"
12866,Jason Hartman Part 3: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),kurak kurakk,@George Gammon do you think is it likely that US could have adjustable rate loans like in many countries in EU? That destroys the whole idea of Refi till you die and IIDD...

It’s only works well when you have price appreciation and  here in Las Vegas banks are still sitting on these foreclosed properties. <br>I also disagree with his comments on gold. <br>Never in the history of America has this so-called experiment called quantitative easing...  I mean economic stimulus injection..., I mean who knows what it’s called now, has ever been tried before. <br>Personally I’m still going to wait for the housing market collapse and then I’ll probably buy.<br>What most people don’t realize is major banks are still holding millions of foreclosed properties on their books.

Why is this health crisis not being addressed ?? -- My Theory -- To kill us off before we can collect social security (62), take dispersals from IRA&#39;s (59.5, with mandatory @ 70.5), Medicare/medicaid (65), and Pension payouts at age 65.  We also know that workman productivity declines with age. Its also a fact that seniors are not active shoppers or consumers and to an economy that is 74% consumerism they are not active participants (They have a house, furnishings etc, they even wear clothes that are a decade old) --- This is how our government is going to handle unfunded liabilities like SS and Medicare -- This is how pensions will compensate for lack of funding -- kill us off before we get a chance to become liabilities to the system"

All we have to do is read his words. No matter how long time you seek happiness, you wont find it unitll you find the creator. Everything produced in this world from a human being has it&#39;s manual, since he/she who created that specific product surely he/she knows best how to use it. God created human being, he knows exactly how we should interact in this world. The problem is that we have put our trust in individuals, and as long as we do so, we will always lose. Returning to god is the only way. It&#39;s not an easy thing for people to do now adays, and why is that ? very simpel, governtment, democracy, the society tells you what freedom is, the freedom of speech, all these lies has people taken deep down in their hearts, so going back to something called religion which restrict you from many things, as drinking alcohol (bad) we all know that) , your inner desire for doing things you are not <a href=""http://allowed.to/"">allowed.to</a> regarding the Gospel, the quran, having sex without marriage. All these restrctions are not easy to implement in this ongoing society. But it&#39;s the only way, the good old days. Please I only which the best for all individuals, Don&#39;t care where you are from and what religion you follow. We people have to respect eachother, no matter what, but the powerful people are doing everything to split us apart, yet we can&#39;t achieve power, and thats what they want, they wants us weak.

12910,"Stanley Druckenmiller: Reveals Secrets About Timing Market Crash, Inflation, The Fed!",George Gammon,NOTE:  Wanted to further clarify my statement &quot;allocating resources can only have a positive/negative effect or negative/negative.&quot;  This is why government or the Fed misallocating those resources is so damaging to the economy and the country.  It&#39;s very hard to allocate those resources well enough to have a net positive effect because there&#39;s always an offsetting negative.

I almost didn&#39;t make it to avoid redundancy, but I felt it was important to show how the central bankers see QE, debt and spending (it is at the center of their entire world view).  Also, I see in the comments all the time, people don&#39;t understand how the Fed can print so much money and it not cause severe inflation, rightfully so.

12950,Quantitative Easing: Will It Cause Hyperinflation? (ANSWER REVEALED),Doktor Onyx,"Great video George! Bank of England must have one of the most honest central bankers! They even admit that they are inflating assets prices not consumption. Consumption in the future could even fall due to QE, because people will need to repay huge debt for inflated housing prices or speculation on the stock markets. QE may increase trust in central banks (in sense that they will always help inflate asset bubbles with expanding their balance sheet), but should not increase trust into economy. They are carrying out QE because economy is in trouble and central bank can reach only financial markets. Byproduct  of this is zombified economy. QE also devalue currency and devaluation of the currency is also devaluation of the trust in the economy of this currency. Another hit for the economy. But who cares. I am still waiting good explanation what is the exit from this trap? 1% of the richest who will have 99,99% of all assets escape to the Mars with Elon Musk as pilot and Jeff Bezos as navigator?

12955,Quantitative Easing: Will It Cause Hyperinflation? (ANSWER REVEALED),EDWARD RICHARDSON,"What is lacking in this discussion is the welfare states driving these policies. If the &quot;rich get richer&quot; then what do non-rich get? Answer: 75m Americans are on &quot;free&quot; govt healthcare they have no business having (Medicaid). Another 45m Americans do not even pay for the food they eat (Food Stamps, a trillion dollars each Farm Bill). About as many elderly have healthcare (Medicare) that boggles the mind. I&#39;ve seen an elderly couple near me spend six figures easy on hospital visits that were not medical emergencies save one where the old man fell out of a tree doing something he should have been doing. These individuals have been clocking well over $3000/mo in SSI for decades now. Don&#39;t even get me started on Medicare Part D, $100b drug program for these people. Legal immigrants into the US are entitled to all of the above, and in certain cases, so are illegals. <br><br>Now then, govt workers.... <br><br>The unfunded pension liability for federal employees alone - w/ their insane defined benefits - is $4.3T. The &quot;funding gap&quot; for state employees in the US is well over a trillion. Why do we need 10m government employees in the United States? <br><br>Next up - illegal foreign nationals. There are tens of millions in the US, now imagine one illegal working construction paying no federal or state taxes). His children cost each between $10-$20k yr for their schooling. His family has access to programs, to emergency healthcare. 90% of all narcotics in the US streaming across the Southern border furthering the already insane law enforcement bureaucracies&#39; spending but the real hit is paying and providing healthcare for a quarter-million Dept of Homeland Security employees to NOT WORK half their lives. <br><br>Social Security - the notion in this nation that we are going to have a national pension scheme (utterly alien just a lifetime ago) - has a $10 T deficit. <br><br>But we&#39;re worried about &quot;the rich?&quot; Had Americans - and Western nations in general - not sold out to big govt welfare and monster govt apparatus - maybe they would&#39;ve had a chance to become wealthier rather than settle for Netflix, Medicaid, and a full belly. Have to ask ourselves what it would have been like for the govt to just provide for common defense, and never have all those trillions taken out of the economy (and mind you the petty $3T taken in taxes does not even cover the TITANIC debt this nation is in). There are 300,000 regulations for factories in the US alone. We got the socialist utopia (or a Left-wing capitalism version of it), what would the full-on version look like? Probably not 40m on food stamps and 50 years of welfare dependency in the black community driving their insane 77% illegitimacy rate (Husband = no welfare)."

Is one of the big risks during a reset the nationalization of mining stocks?  This is the hardest aspect for me to game, trying to balance my greed with safety.  Assume one already knows to eschew ETFs and derivatives.  For instance, the fact that a country such as Canada has no gold in its Central bank hints that they will be more likely in a crisis to nationalize [though they never have, and it would end business ethos]; and it seems that what are touted as safe jurisdictions are just an illusion.  Lastly, it&#39;s a pain to get the stock certificate, does that help or is there a much bigger picture?

The point, I was trying to emphasis, and I think this is THE MOST IMPORTANT take away of the video, is YOU ARE JUST AS SMART AS  THE  WALL ST.  PRO&#39;s.  Never think that because you can&#39;t understand something it means xyz person is smarter.  You are just as intelligent if not more so intelligent, the only reason it seems confusing is because you don&#39;t know the lingo.  The concepts, once you understand the language used, are actually very simple.  So don&#39;t feel intimidated, with a little effort (and a few of my videos) you can understand this just as well as the wall st. insiders.  And the better you understand this stuff the better financial decisions you can make for you and your family!   Thx for watching everyone!  ;)"

13019,Money Secrets Revealed: Discover Your Key To Economic Survival!,No BS,"Bitcoin is still a crap shoot. Unless it is backed by something of value it will only be speculative and nothing but a digital fiat. God forbid you lose your &quot;wallet&quot; or accidentally punch in the wrong account. You can kiss your digits goodbye. On top of that, not many places accept cryptos. Have we hit 100 different cryptos yet? Even Credit Unions use Hashgraph, which is faster and cheaper and consistent. Blockchain technology is tracked by the government, so there is no reason to risk crypto volatility. Eventually distributed ledger/Hashgraph will become more mainstream, like Visa, and not be private network - if it hasn&#39;t already. Things are still evolving, but until cryptos are backed by gold or silver they are not much better than gambling in the stock market or using the dollar - in my opinion. At least the dollar is accepted by all businesses in the US, including person to person transactions, such as Craigslist. Try buying a used tractor with Bitcoin. LOL"

13036,LIVE Q&A,SolidState,"Thanks George, a ton of wisdom and insight but I&#39;m wondering if you can elaborate on your comments regarding the depression of 1920-21. <br><br>The suggestion is that the government did very little and therefore the recovery was much faster than it was in the 30&#39;s where government intervention lead to a longer recovery. <br><br>Of course the circumstances surrounding each Depression are quite different, but I&#39;m curious how the relative lack of intervention after 1920-21 (which may have lead to a quicker recovery) was a better pill to swallow than the one prescribed in the 30&#39;s, when the latter lead to decades of relatively stable and sustained prosperity and the former lead to the highest levels of wealth inequality for the era and of course, the Great Depression, less than a decade later.<br><br>Again, I know the circumstances of each depression are quite different... one came shortly after a World War and the other lead into a World War, and of course, there are still disagreements today regarding the cause and recoveries of both... but I was curious if you had further insights on this because from a layman&#39;s perspective, one recovery was fast but short-lived and the other, although slower, lasted far longer and lead to far greater prosperity over time.<br><br>Thanks again for all the content you&#39;re putting out as well.

13040,LIVE Q&A,Erik Isbrandt,George i missed the live stream. I was traveling. My question is how would short term rental units and multi family rental units perform in hyperinflation?? If the dollar becomes worthless i’d be collecting $200 of toilet paper per night. And have to pay $1400 of toilet paper per month. Is it even worth it at this point??  What’s the point of hustling in order to get paid worthless toilet paper??
13041,LIVE Q&A,Erik Isbrandt,"Airbnb for example. Apartment would cost about $1400 per month and each individual night would rent for about $200.  If the apartment lease is fixed at $1400 per month, but hyperinflation occurs, i’d be paying toilet paper for the apartment lease, then in return i’d be collecting toilet paper for the individual night stays. Why go through the hastle of owning a short term airbnb unit or 6-12 multifamily apartment units if i have to invest time in exchange for toilet paper??  <br><br>I wouldn’t be owning the place if i did short term airbnb. But i do own a 6 unit apartment building so at least that asset wont be totally inflated away. <br><br>Im just not sure if it makes more sense to exit now and cash up and buy a different, larger property (8-12 units) after the real estate discount sale for the same price i sell the 6 unit building for. This would increase my net operating income. But if dollar inflates away, what’s the point of owning apartment units if people are going to pay me $900 in toilet paper money??  <br><br>I guess the key would be to purchase at the low and immediately start accepting the new currency that is issued??"

13057,Jason Hartman Part 2: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),Cary Hawkins,"Am I seeing this right?  The major risk with this strategy is if income somehow goes down - i.e. laid off at job, business goes south, family member or self gets really sick, or some other major catastrophe.  Assuming these things stay static, then this makes a lot of sense, but life has taught me that things do not stay static and can change VERY rapidly.   Am I missing something?"
13058,Jason Hartman Part 2: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),George Maximus,"So even at high home prices now, we can still buy rental properties and not have to worry about home price collapse or depreciation because as long as you can still make $$ from the rental properties with positive cash flow and not have to pay taxes on those gains because of the depreciation. So this will off set any fears of housing market collapse in the future, and also to leverage and barrow more money to buy more income producing properties at 30 year fix rate and wait because the accumulated debt will be inflated away by that time. So when homes appreciate in value, take out equity loans to buy more rental properties. If they depreciated because of bad market conditions, the rental incomes is tax free from depreciation. Wow, am I getting this right? This is a win win strategy with almost no risk involved assuming that rental market stays strong and people continues to have jobs to pay rent even if there is a economic collapse. So what do we do if they can’t pay rent, start lowering them as long as we can cover the bank interest we are ok and just wait it out? I understand everyone needs a roof over their head and housing is essential to survival so people will need a place to live, just like they need to food. So, do we still buy homes now? Don’t wait? Since there doesn’t seem like there is a downside to it. Will you expect home prices to come down in the near future and perhaps buy when it happens or is this just trying to time the market. Since there is massive QE and money printing, home prices is not expected to come down and will appreciate from here and not down."

13063,Jason Hartman Part 2: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),Tommy Boy,"NASA WE GOT A PROBLEM.  Jason?  Question: 1) Are you personally guaranteeing these loans? If yes? No need going further, lousy advice. Question: 2) What happens if real estate values drop? Very well could be underwater on these homes and not able to sell. This would put you in a major competitive disadvantage to other properties. Example: I bought the house next door for half the price (foreclosures). My rent of course could be much lower and I’d still make a profit. Jason if these are truly your investment strategies?  Congratulations! You have mimicked Wall Street investment banks perfectly. Sorry I’m half pissed even hearing this. George thinks like an “honest investor”. Taking funds to purchase another home.  Thats called leveraging and growing a company. Living off those funds? Are you serious? Sorry George,  I think the world of you. You give Nothing but solid advice. Jason not so much. This advice is similar to saying, live off your credit cards. Just keep getting higher credit limits. When the bank won’t raise the limits anymore and you can’t make payments just file for bankruptcy."

In video one, you guys mention that we are late in the cycle. So this advice would apply in general to linear markets?"
13068,Jason Hartman Part 2: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),ron johnson,"George, I have a few questions. Remember a few years ago, Italy made international headlines because they had to file for bankruptcy? The banks were gonna come in and start seizing Italy&#39;s assets. This disaster was avoided because the EU came in and bailed them out.  Would the assets the banks could have seized include Land? <br><br>I ask because the same thing could and probably will at this point happen to the US. When a bank seizes assets, it doesnt sit on them. they try and liquidate those assets to recoup some of the money they lost from the defaulted loans. If the central banks seize land, then I would think they could and probably would liquidate it. If this were to happen, isnt it possible that another country could end up buying those assets, and depending on the buyer, we could lose our  sovereignty as a nation, and maybe even our freedom? <br><br>I would also like to ask you to talk about how people dont own the homes they live in, even if they have fully paid off their mortgages. meaning, in the event of a default, if all of the above is true,  people who have fully paid off their mortgages could end up having their homes seized because of what the government has done behind everyone&#39;s back."
13069,Jason Hartman Part 2: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),George Gammon,"That&#39;s a great question Ron, I don&#39;t know the answer to that.  I&#39;d also point out, you never own your home because the government has a permanent lien on it via property taxes.  Don&#39;t pay those and government will take that house you think you own.  Rather quickly too."

Buy rentals when you have savings to do so. Never ever risk your primary home. I need to get off the board tonight. Getting too pissed at Jason’s advice."
13073,Jason Hartman Part 2: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),Kevin Belcher,"​@George Gammon my only caution are these mortgages are &quot;owner occupied&quot; as in we financed, then moved out of the house then rented them   . . I have 4 units this way, and they&#39;re very low interest rates (3.5% and 4.25%) . .  I DO want to own them outright someday, but it would also be awesome to own more . . hard to say what to do in this bubble market I&#39;m in."

13078,Jason Hartman Part 2: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),Paul Rey,Depreciation is another Government&#39;s scam. If I buy property for 100k and rental income is 10k I should calculate this way: 10k (income) - 100k (expenses) = -90k (loss). Profit = 0. Tax (let&#39;s say 20% on profit): 0@20%=0. The loss should be put forward to next year. I should start paying tax after min 10 years (If no other expenses) !!! I would send these tax law makers to working camp in Siberia USSR !

I didn&#39;t explain that in detail because I wanted to keep the vid shorter.  There many different ways it works (I&#39;m not familiar with all of them).  But imagine the ETF was for Apple and Microsoft.  If the secondary market price was higher (price for ETF shares) than the normal shares of Apple and Microsoft, Mike would buy the shares of Apple and Microsoft on the primary market, exchange them for new shares in the ETF, and sell those back on the secondary market to those investors wanting the ETF shares.  Mike then pockets the spread.  It works in reverse order is the price on the secondary market is lower than the underlying asset.  Hope that makes more sense.  Thx for watching everyone!"

If something is too expensive we short the stock. There is not enough money on the noobs side to keep the price up. The vast majority of the money going in and out of the market is controlled by organizations. The noob trader is just used as a tool for most institutions as they bet against them typically. Micheal Burry is often wrong and gives no real time period for his statements. He predicted something but wasn&#39;t the first. Many people were discussing the housing market crash and his timing was terribly off nearly bankrupting his company.

13172,Jason Hartman Part 1: Insider Secrets That'll Make You Money! (REVEALED),George Gammon,NOTE:  Wanted to explain inflation a little further.  The reason your debt goes down in value is because your mortgage payments are fixed but your income goes up with inflation.  Although your purchasing power doesn&#39;t go up with goods and services (because their prices rises as well) but your income DOES go up relative to your loan payments because they&#39;re fixed.

The only problem is that I have to live in the property I buy, so buying according to RV ratio in another State is impossible.

Your also have avino silver and gold, first majestic silver and silvercrest.  When u see these last two year charts you&#39;ll think your in the wrong business. You also have royalty companies and companies like mineworx and enviroleach.  You are going down a huge rabbit hole if you look at miners especially the Juniors.  Mike Maloney had a study that I think went back to the 70s that the best gold ratio was 30% in a passive portfolio including real estate and stocks.  It came out 2-3 months ago.  Forbes said best investment last 20 years was real estate and gold second.  We all know real estate is in bubble, and gold had been in a almost ten year bear market,  and rental income is much different than just real estate, I don&#39;t think forbes counted rental income at all but gold is a good investment especially to save your money till the crash."

13242,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,People keep asking how to get started without a lot of money. Doesn’t have to be in real estate. I own some real estate but have made millions on small businesses. First key rule to making money is to get off your butt. Ultimately most people aren’t rich because they are afraid of failure. Don’t be afraid to start something. My mindset is I’m throwing darts. Now let’s see what sticks. Not every idea works. You just move on to the next. Good example is what George is doing right here. He’s throwing a dart. Guy loves this stuff and it looks like he hit the bulls eye. He didn’t know if this would work with a 100 percent certainty but he still tried. This channel is awesome because George is training your mind on how money and business works. Trust me that’s the hard part.
13243,LIVE Q&A,M K,"Excellent. Thank you, sir. Have a good one."
13244,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,I’ve done it both ways but it never hurts to have corporate protection. It’s Never been easier to start a corporation thru companies like legal zoom. Just remember you’ll have extra costs like tax preparation and insurance. All about how much money you’re making. Very good question. So many people don’t realize companies can be quite daring when incorporated. I remember the “good old  days” when you didn’t have to personally guarantee loans thru your corporation. It was a license to steal. Good luck and go get em. Next week we’ll talk about “tax write offs”. Reason enough to own a company. HINT (almost everything is a write off). Lol George will handle that one.
13245,LIVE Q&A,M K,"Tommy Boy, should I buy from auctions under my personal name or through an LLC or something?"
13246,LIVE Q&A,M K,Thank Y’all very much. Great info. Appreciate it!
13247,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,George Gammon: Ultimately people come to channels like this with an underlying question. How do I make money? Experience has taught me that most businesses fail because people don’t understand what you’re teaching. Business is so easy when people finally get it. I have two boys 24 and 27. Both are millionaires. Why? because they were taught what your teaching. The other night I over heard my kid on the Internet. His friend said “man what a great gift. Your dad taught you how to become rich”. That’s you George. Teach this people. They just don’t think right to make money. 👍

I like Rickards&#39; idea of a discounted metals backing but maybe 40% is not low enough. Gold is not the only Commonwealth. There is LAND (think Rentenmark), food reserves and other metal assets such as silver, copper, platinum, and in-stock industrial metals. Then there are nuclear and conventional force assets that you need to stop people taking your gold and other productive assets.<br><br>It could be problematical if the gold price rockets upto $10,000 to $50,000 so unrealistically ahead of its cost of production. You can think of the gold price being in part determined by expanded bills of materials for gold mining companies (Energy costs, plant and equipment, labour and on costs, political risk costs plus freight, secure handling, profit and then wholesale costs and retail margins). It would take time for the gold supply to rise but if its value increases 10-50 fold expect a gold mining boom."

Sure, in some cases it is really bad like Tesla, but in general not so. Companies are making good money and they are paying dividends.<br><br>I would think the dividend to stock price ratio on Nikkei was really low around its peak, and today it is more &quot;normal&quot;.<br><br>Would be interesting to see some compariosn charts showing dividend/stockprice ratio.

13291,Jeff Gundlach: His Shocking Predictions Revealed! (MARKET WON'T RECOVER),FlibbidyFleu,"I don&#39;t know... ...while the Standard Statistic company was founded in 1927 the S&amp;P (500) didn&#39;t exist until 1957 so what you are presenting is NOT a chart of the S&amp;P 500, around 1930 the Standard Statistic Company only tracked 90 stocks. Also your charts are (I believe) using a logarithmic scale which always makes things look dramatic and crushes the idea of an &quot;average trend line&quot;. Also I do NOT ignore the entire history of the market. Also your white board drawing is inaccurate as it shows the &#39;82 decline being lower than the &#39;57 decline. I&#39;ve also noticed that you refer to Bloomberg, reading Bloomberg is not a good way to approach a market economy in my opinion. Also as a point it should be noted that if you invested in the Nikkei in 1970 you would have seen significant growth today although I agree there is a bubble on stock prices. I&#39;m not saying you are wrong (or right), I just think your logic and reasoning are wrong."

If $10k compounded 10% annual gain continues for 30 yrs, your imaginary investment value would have been over $160k by now assuming no 3 deducted values. 401k does not get taxed something he did not mention vs our own stock income gets taxed.

Broker,"Love your vid series George, it&#39;s great work.This one too has some important takeaways about market timing...BUT...your supposition about how the advisory community reports average growth rates is just flat out wrong. As an adviser I can tell you that it is NOT  standard industry practice to use a simple average to calculate historical investment returns.  That approach is in fact so simplistic and leads to such significant errors in calculation that it&#39;s kind of ridiculous to suggest it, not to mention that it would be immediately obvious to the average investor that something was wrong just by looking at their account statements over time (eg.  -50% +50% +30% = 10% three-year average reported by adviser when statement shows loss??) I agree that average annual returns do mislead, but it is not about faulty math, it is more about the historical time frames chosen to represent the &quot;long term&quot; average (goes to your point about market timing) as well as failure to address just how difficult it is at a practical level for investors to stay invested through periods where markets are collapsing."

13350,Andrew Yang And UBI: Economic Freedom Or Economic ARMAGEDDON?,jack adam,"You are wrong on your insurance stuff and you are certainly wrong on your chart comparison.  One is an idealism, Yang is application.   Socialism can’t be implemented without communism, capitalism is a failure without some socialism aspect.   Yang’s UBI is more grounded then the idealism.   Yang’s UBI wipe off any welfare under 1000, and destroy the stigma of giving free money to the poor.   It also increases market capital flow via consumer spending.   The income tax  and Value added tax generated from the consumer spending will not only fund UBI, but it also funds government budget plan.   Government budget is at a dead lock because tax cut = not enough budget, and more government spending = more deficit.  The tax revenue generated from more business transaction solves recession.  Inflation comes from printing more money, and UBI doesn’t require more money, it’s generated from tractions.   Market competition is still there to prevent monopoly.  With safety net, the renter will have more leverage against the landlord.  I use to watch some of your investment (especially insurance one) video and it’s completely backward, I suggest you learn some thing or two from Dave Ramsey"

13366,Andrew Yang And UBI: Economic Freedom Or Economic ARMAGEDDON?,Ankur Sethi,"Yang was practical. Like he suggested term limits but excluding grandfathering in the current set of politicians. At least that way it gets passed.<br><br>So similarly if you want to replace means testing with UBI you don&#39;t just say you will get rid of welfare. You start UBI and even if people are getting less money from it, they will start to take it as they don&#39;t have to file crazy paperwork and they get freedom. So a lot of arguments in the beginning I don&#39;t agree with. You have to see the long term.<br><br>Also saying no economic growth at 1k because you could then give people 5k doesn&#39;t hold up. The goal is not to get people to stop working. The goal is to establish a floor that doesn&#39;t disincentivize work. Below poverty level cash which doesn&#39;t cover rent and food should not be enough to stop people from working. But it can grow the economy.<br><br>I absolutely agree with people leaving the United States. That was an issue that was not addressed.<br><br>The other arguments with VAT and slowing down investment are solid.  Gammon concludes that even Friedman&#39;s UBI is not workable in the current environment is very telling."

How can Yang call it a &quot;dividend&quot; if the people receiving the payout aren&#39;t INVESTING anything?!?
13370,Andrew Yang And UBI: Economic Freedom Or Economic ARMAGEDDON?,Ira S,"Consumers will spend their UBI therefore contributing to corporate profit which will mean corporations will be paying more taxes to fund the UBI, its a cycle of funds which would definitely increase velocity. Prices are determined by demand, not supply. If an investor buys a truckload of wheat flour at $10 a sack, and the price goes down to $5 a sack, he is going to sell it at $5 a sack no matter what. If a landlord gets taxed more on his property, but rent prices determined by renters and competition go below the amount for the landlord to profit, he is still going to have to rent out his properties at a price determined by how much his tenants are willing to pay. not what his expenses are."
13371,Andrew Yang And UBI: Economic Freedom Or Economic ARMAGEDDON?,Ira S,"Your logic is a bit flawed here, If people have more money in their bank accounts, banks will have MORE money to lend.

13381,LIVE Q&A,Whit4You KissThis,Well I&#39;m not george - but I will say there are very very few places in US in whch the housing market isn&#39;t in a bubble - in many cases a huge bubble - so unless you are extremely familiar with your own areas bubble situation - than getting a 30 year loan will put you under water on your mortgage when the economy crashes - crashing the housing bubble too - meaning you will owe more than your house is worth... and sure unless your market is in one of he higher ed bubbles - someday your house will be worth what you ended up paying for it - but that could be a long time down the road - so you&#39;d be stuck paying for it no matter what happens. <br><br>Also unlike my whole life of telling people to always try and have a decent supply of cash on hand - it&#39;s the opposite now - the purchaing power of that 12k is going to be dropping dramatically very soon... so it&#39;s a very good idea for you to go ahead and stock up on anything/everything you are going to need to buy in the next few years... this will keep you from having to use some of that gold/silver to buy those things at a much higher price in 1 or 2 years... just my 2 cents on all of this ... the repo market situation is now spreading - even to India - which based on all my research was in an actual real &#39;normal&#39; economy still - unlike so many other countries with their totally broken systems like ours.

13396,LIVE Q&A,Homestead Engineering,"Hello George,  I really enjoy your videos but we have to talk about the live stream...  You need to get up to speed on a few things:<br>1. Don&#39;t try to answer every question.  You get so far behind that we can&#39;t interact with you.  You just go to the latest question and that way you stay with the current conversation.  People will re-ask questions.  Just try it once and you will see the difference immediately.<br>2. The standard for YouTube live streams is that questions are in ALL CAPS while comments are in lower case. <br>3. You need to have at least one moderator to delete the trolls.  Just select someone you trust, click on them and add moderator.  You can always remove them if they don&#39;t pan out.<br>4. lose the interrogation light.  :)<br>Your doing great!  See you Sunday."
13397,LIVE Q&A,George Gammon,"Ok that makes more sense.  Yeah we set Sebastian up as a moderator for next week.  I&#39;ll have to remember that, all caps for questions and focus on the most recent question...got it.  Thx for the help!"

13400,LIVE Q&A,Kevin Belcher,"George - why do you recommend single family homes over multifamily? I&#39;m thinking if selling my house for profit taking, but have other rentals so I know the business. Curious why you prefer renting single family homes instead."
13401,LIVE Q&A,R M,"George Gammon I don’t know about the rest of the country but multi-units are so overpriced here in California. They go faster than single family homes in the nicer areas. Heck, they get scooped up at a premium even in the not-so-nice (and downright scary) areas in LA!"
13402,LIVE Q&A,Kevin Belcher,"@George Gammon thanks George, I think I am going to profit take now, as I can realize a 125k profit. Will buy more rentals with 20% down . . Do you own your real estate outright,  or does the bank? I want to pay off the loans with inflated dollars, I just dont know how long I&#39;ll have to wait until the dollar devaluation hits."
13403,LIVE Q&A,George Gammon,Personally I like them a little better because they&#39;re easier to sell if you want the liquidity.  But I&#39;m a big fan of both.  Especially if you can get a triplex and house hack.

13408,LIVE Q&A,George Demakakos,"George, what do you think about REITS?"
13409,LIVE Q&A,George Gammon,I prefer to own the asset outright.  I like being in control of my portfolio and I think theres less downside to your principal in a stock mkt crash.

13418,Huge Channel Announcements!  (BIG CHANGES REVEALED),Michael Klein,"George - Continuing to catch up since I first heard about you. I can see that you are focused on out of US real estate which is wonderful. What I have yet to see from a passive income point is the paper side of real estate, i.e. mortgage notes. Since this is being posted in July 2020, this video is still unaware of the coming pandemic. As a worldwide issue, your renters may very likely be impacted in Columbia just like the US. Whether you receive rents or mortgage payments, it is still passive income. With the passive market being impacted heavily in the States either from renters or paying the banks and getting forbearances, both receivers are not getting their currency. So, I would like to hear something about your perspective on the the paper business, since I prefer this in stead of brick and mortar. I prefer being in the role of a &#39;bank&#39; versus owner and have to concern myself with the 3 T&#39;s (Toilets, Trash and Termites) and just receive principal and interest. However, I am not educated in the note business in other countries. Since we are in the midst of a global pandemic everything is Topsy-turvey. So currently I prefer to stash dollars into mostly Silver and some gold since the gold/silver ratio is currently favoring silver. I am also considering getting back into Cryptos which would be about 1-2% of my portfolio. Since more markets are coming online to accept cryto currencies, it is a better resource to use this area versus having the FED and Gov&#39;t and SEC being Big Brother to take their share in US Dollars and Capital gains. So, hopefully being over 7 months old on this video, staff will look back on this and bring to your attention"

Anyway, the dollar was probably at a secular top and the interventionists intervened and caused a much bigger crash than the correction that might have been about to occur. Although, the dollar index is a terrible metric because it&#39;s geometrically weighted, so if one of the other currencies goes to zero, USDX goes towards infinity.

13479,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),r pietryk,Here is truth 🐰
13480,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),trixn,"This is so wrong in so many laughable ways. The government is not supposed to hire the currently unemployed people to build bridges and wind farms. No MMT proponent has ever said such a silly thing. You are arguing nothing but straw mans. The job guarantee is explicitly NOT an entrepreneurial program where the government acts as a company that is in competition to the private sector. The government should do what every sane person would do to build a bridge and that is pay companies that build bridges. Those companies will eventually expand their business as a result of an increased demand and those people will go from the job guarantee to the a private sector employment. Of course, and MMT proponents stress this point very much, the government can NOT and should not buy more goods and services than the economy is able to provide. So if the construction industry is operating at capacity and it is not to be expected that it can find more people to hire or it can&#39;t buy more raw materials it needs the government should cut spendings because any more spending would indeed just cause inflation.<br><br>The problem with Venezuela is simply that it relied purely on oil exports to finance their massive dependence on imports. When oil prices collapsed it couldn&#39;t pay its debt in foreign currency which effectively reduces the monetary sovereignty. Venezuela can only buy goods and services that are available in their own currency. With regards to a foreign currency Venezuela is a currency user like everybody else. In Zimbabwe a poorly planned land reform destroyed much of production capacity. This is nothing that can simply be fixed by spending more money and not MMT proponent claims that."
13481,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),Rob,You are WRONG.  MMT  has a job guarantee  program . It is one of Mitchell&#39;s  policies and their job guarantee is a pivotal part of MMT .<br>You contradict yourself. You say &quot;Those companies will eventually expand their business as a result of an increased demand and those people will go from the job guarantee to the a private sector employment.&quot;.  If it is the case that firms will employ those job guarantee people then they would have  employed them already But they haven&#39;t because the situation is the unemployed are there for a number of reasons which includes efficiencies mean they cost more to employ than is justified. That does Not automatically change due to a demand for more goods because  the increased demand just re allocates demand from other areas.   Their idea it self ignores the cost factor entirely.
13482,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),L H,"MMT is just an perfect excuse for government to spend way more money than they should. If MMT works, Venezuela could just impose extreme high taxation to solve their hyperinflation? but, why haven&#39;t they done it? in addition, there is one country on earth which has already on MMT - China. Chinese Government could pretty much print as much money as they want to (their central bank is NOT independent entity in the economy); but why China hasn&#39;t ruled out the poverty, and many people are still suffering from unemployment? MMT folks, can you guys explain? You guys keep saying this video is incorrect - which part is incorrect, please explain."
13483,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),Roman Pilip,"Good old USSR, that we trying to make &quot;Great again&quot;, guaranteed jobs for everyone. If someone did not want the job, government would make an offer no one  would refuse. Popular slogan of that time &quot;If they think they are paing us, let them think we are working&quot;. MMT is not modern."
13484,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),Rob,If anyone believes MMT they must be in denial of historical facts and the proof is that NO MMT pusher can explain why their version of history and the present reality is contray to proven historical fact. MMT claims the national debt does Not have to be paid back when the reality is nobody is going to buy government bonds if they didn&#39;t have to be paid out and that is the national debt being paid.
13485,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),OurWorld,"This is not how MMT works. If you don&#39;t agree with the theory, at least explain it correctly."

Furthermore, they see very little practical distinction between keystrokes to create money and selling bonds."

(ANSWER REVEALED),Herr von Berg,"George MMT does say the very opposit, the goverment does not get the money from the taxppayer the goverment is the issuer and taxes are there for pulling(deleting) the money out of the system.

13495,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),Jason Burnett,I&#39;m only 2 chapters into the book The Deficit Myth and already know this entire video is nonsense.

13496,Modern Monetary Theory: Utopia OR Catastrophe? (ANSWER REVEALED),william snyder,"Dollar is world reserve currency.

Maybe this is the time? My only caveat is Peter owns a lot of gold mining and investment so he have an interest to push the narrative.
13522,LIVE Q&A,Michael Klein,"George - Since I heard about you only 3 weeks ago, I am getting through all your fabulous videos. So, I have a wonderful potion from these questions because you and none of the participants knew of the Pandemic adding to the current Rescission (really a Depression). So, I can look back by bringing issues forward and seeing what the FED has done as well as the Gov&#39;t in the U.S. and it is sadly Keynesian all over the place. For my part, being in a wheelchair and this pandemic, travel is too problematic for my health so, I must get thru this and take US dollars and place in 1% cryptos and Gold and Definitely Silver because the gold - Silver ratios are more beneficial right now and when silver reaches expected prices, I transfer it into Gold."

13536,LIVE Q&A,GeeDub,"Definetly a legend George ! Best channel on markets, financial etc.. keep it up !!"
13537,LIVE Q&A,Potato,"@ George Gammon, Can you provide some investment ideas with our 401k? My company matches about 10% @ 100% so I can&#39;t say no. I don&#39;t know where to park it. Like you said everything is overpriced and the coming debt correction, I don&#39;t know where to put it. In the last years, I have been 100% in Microsoft because in terms of all the financial ratios it&#39;s been on the lower end compared to other companies such as Amazon, Netflix, and Facebook. However, I think it&#39;s still way overpriced. I was planning to move into GLD soon, however your video about HBSC being the trustee scared me. So now I don&#39;t know where to park it. I don&#39;t want to be in cash either because of the inflation risk. As if you look at the m1 money supply, the fed inject 300billion into the market this year ALONE! that is about 8% inflation."
13538,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,"Potato: Awesome job! That’s a really, really good start for your age.  As the years tick away you’ll be amazed of what that turns into. I think back when I was so excited at 20k. Sometimes it seems almost unbelievable what it’s turned into."
13539,LIVE Q&A,Potato,"@Tommy Boy i&#39;m young, I only have 40k in my 401k. My retirement time frame is 30 years and I am very tolerant of risk. If I bet wrong, I can wait it out. I understand Diversification, but I just don&#39;t have the time to track all the stocks I invest in, checking the financials and study the industry. I agree with Warren Buffets&#39; view of invest in a few stocks, but know the industry inside and out and know the company financials."
13540,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,"Potato: Not sure what kind of money you’re playing with but “wow”. Everything in one stock? Diversification is a must. Yes, 401k’s are like being stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. Shocking information George revealed about GLD. Still I’d take that over being heavily invested in certainstocks. To hedge my wife’s 401k. I borrowed a portion from the account at 2 percent interest and bought physical gold. All this being said it’s hard to turn down matching funds. I’ll take that bet every time."
13541,LIVE Q&A,James Helliwell,this channel is great
13542,LIVE Q&A,J S,Will have to watch for these in the future.
13543,LIVE Q&A,Abhinav Gautam,"Awesome Q&amp;A, George. Just got done, with the replay. Thanks for all the hard work/ valuable insights. I get to learn so much from this channel. Really appreciate it!!"
13544,LIVE Q&A,Pekka Rousu,"Sir. Gold 5-10%. You say you like getting paid by investments. I get that. But why thinking that 90-95% of the money must be concentrated in getting paid or hoping for price appreciation? For me it sounds a bit greedy. Only 5-10% for &quot;insurance&quot;. Would I like a 10% insurance on my house? No. I think most people want higher insurance than that, or? We all have different taste for risk, but 5% non risk???<br><br>If you have millions of dollars than a 10% insurance is ok I guess, you&#39;ll be fine even if most things in the world goes badly. But if you only have little money, isn&#39;t then a good idea to have a higher insurance than 5-10%? Then it is even more important to insure your money in my opinion. Not everybody are millionaires and can afford great losses on the &quot;casino&quot; as I call papier money.<br><br>Or are you afraid to be called a gold bug?😀 i&#39;ve heard Richards talking hours on end about gold, SDR, meltdown of fiat money, reset, war, hyperinflation, riots.... And then say 10% gold is ok. No matter what year or risk for total collapse. Always 10%. Sir, I don&#39;t get it. Why not more? Is it so damn important to earn money on 90% of your investments? Is it so important to become richer all the time? Really? To have 10% in gold is for me somebody who hates gold but invest in gold anyway.<br><br>// Goldbug Pekka"
13545,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,"Pekka Rousu; I just re read your post. Believe it or not, I’m going to modify my position. You changed my mind. It depends on your particular financial position. If I had an average income and savings. I’d probably be pretty much all in on gold. Yes, millionaires do think “why would I want $900,000 in gold. Seems excessive. 200k-500k seems like enough."
13546,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,"I agree with George. Diversification is everything. I look at gold as an insurance policy not an investment. Never put all your eggs in one basket. I personally own gold in case SHTF. At this point gold “should” go thru the roof. Down side? What happens if the government seized all gold. Now you’re broke. What happens if they go to an all digital currency. At that point you couldn’t even buy or sell gold. Nobody would have the capacity to even buy it. Especially if it was deemed illegal. Again don’t put all your eggs in one basket. I own about 7 percent of my wealth in gold. 10 percent is the max I’d even consider. Why own more? Not worth the risk. I have investments making great returns. Why sell those cash cows for gold. Gold is awesome, I love it but not enough to bank my entire future on. My worst nightmare is gold 50k an ounce. That’s not a world anybody would want to live in. PS I just bought more gold this morning. Just not making it my only bet."
13547,LIVE Q&A,George Gammon,"Because RE is just is also a great inflation hedge and it pays you.  What if we don&#39;t have a total financial collapse for 10 years?  With all the cash flow you would have far more gold at 10% than you did before at 50%.  <br><br>Bottom line is do what ever makes you happy, but for me, I&#39;m totally comfortable with 5-10%."
13548,LIVE Q&A,gregsdates,What good is real estate if nobody has the money to pay your rent?
13549,LIVE Q&A,George Gammon,"You&#39;re buying starter homes, entry level, in a depression/recession there will still be people that can afford your rent.  We won&#39;t have 100% unemployment. ;) That said, I totally agree, buying a 350k+ house you might struggle to get renters.  But not a starter 3 bed 2 bath ranch for 140k."
13550,LIVE Q&A,Pekka Rousu,"PE and Schiller is great, BUT they say nothing about corporations debt level. If you compare debt/total asset or if you compare debt/earnings the risk is much  much higher today. Or debt/sales or whatever. On Youtube I NEWER hear anyone talk about debt ratios like that. Only corporate debt in % of GDP.<br><br>BTW. Why does people care about corporation debt to GDP? It&#39;s 45% or something like that. GDP also have public spending and if that increases that effect the ratio (For example 45%). If we would have 2 GDP, one public and one private I can ser the point in comparing &quot;private GDP&quot; to corporate debt. I think Rothbart talked about private GDP leaving out the public sector."
13551,LIVE Q&A,Pekka Rousu,"PE and Schiller and so on is great, BUT what about buy backs? Buy backs screw this figures. Or am I thinking wrongly? Look at Microsoft. Same earnings in dollars as in 2014 but the stock price have increased and according to me due to buy backs.<br><br>If you look at inflows the last 10 years all appreciations are buy backs. Individuals have taken out money, foreigners too and even American institutions. All net buying are corporations themselves = buy backs. And most of buy backs are financed by borrowing more money via issued  bonds. The companies have not improved but stock prices have gone up. In fact, the companies are worse off since they are more in debt.<br><br>BTW. Dividends have gone down, no matter how you calculate it. So profits too have gone to buy backs. Less dividends equals to me as higher risk."
13552,LIVE Q&A,Tommy Boy,Pekka Rousu: Not sure I know exactly what your asking. You’re exactly right on buy backs being a large part of rising markets. When a company buys back their own stocks they reduce the amount of stocks sharing in the earnings. This of course makes the stock price rise (typically). PE ratios (price/earnings) vary depending on market conditions and what an investor is willing to pay for profits. I wouldn’t say “buy backs screw up” PE ratio’s. PE ratios are just “PE ratios. Price of stocks and earnings of company.

13565,Inverted Yield Curve: Discover What EVERYONE IS MISSING!,WisCAT Bijles,"In my view: &quot;interest rates don&#39;t exist&quot;. I feel people get really confused when they think rates can be adjusted. Rates are not cut or hiked. Bonds are being bought or sold, resulting in a change of yields. There can&#39;t be a new bond in town with higher yields. If rates are higher, it means that there&#39;s selling action across the market, increasing yields. Just simply supply and demand."

13574,Inverted Yield Curve: Discover What EVERYONE IS MISSING!,test blustacks,Thanks. Summary: As the yield (coupon) approaches zero the time to get initial face (par) value back through coupon payments goes to infinity. <br>Nb. It&#39;s possible to invest in negative yield junk bonds in Europe. If not sold before maturity or rates go up guaranteed to lose money. If ECB cuts rates again then can sell for a profit. How about a bond with a negative coupon? - you can invest in Danish mortgage backed notes. You lend them money and pay them 0.5% / year for the risk of not getting your money back.
13575,Inverted Yield Curve: Discover What EVERYONE IS MISSING!,Jon Oswald,"I understand that the lower yields mean more duration risk (more price sensitivity).

All do respect sir, I know what I have, would never sell... but knowing I made a good purchase lets me know I’m learning... I paid $7300 for the truck in 2010. I think I got an incredible deal on this truck. It’s been paid for years. Just not having to buy def fluid is a huge savings. It’s currently sitting in a garage away from the weather, with me driving it just enough every week to keep the everything moving to keep it healthy. About 2-4000 miles a year."
13598,How YOU Can Make More Money: (Just Like I Do!),George Gammon,"I think 15k is fair.  It&#39;d be much more if it was a crew cab. Has it always been titled in NC?  If not, where else has it been titled.  That makes a big difference bc ebay buyer will look at carfax to see if it&#39;s lived in a rust state.  And is it&#39;s lived most of its life in AZ (as an example) it&#39;ll get a big premium."

I would like to know  your look on a different  but very related topic. We live in times when everyone is betting on a huge crisis is coming, which seems inevitable. but i think this all might be a  hoax. I watched an interview with a tech specialist and futurist  Jeff Brown. where he described that 2030 world be a totally different from now and there will be an unprecedented expansion. There are tons of new tech which is waiting to move us in the next industrial revolution. Things  like 5G, nuclear fusion reactors, quantum computers, AI , genomics , electric vehicles.  Most of these things are present already some even are still kept hidden just by  moral and ethical concerns,  and of course because the wealthy class needs some time to position  itself on top of all that and ensure things stay this way forever. This might  explain the corporate buyback phenomenon . And  it seems logical move. The government is providing cheap money so the companies can buy back all of their shares. After that the money are gone changed with something digital and the companies have all of their shares so they might start selling again for the next 40 years. Then next crisis will come followed by the next revolution with spaceships, spacemining, immortality and who knows what other crap they come up with and corporate  buybacks for sure  so the cycle will repeat again and again. <br>here is the the link for the interview: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGeN5lrxws"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGeN5lrxws</a>"

13610,Negative Interest Rates DESTRUCTIVE Powers Explained: (SIMPLE & FAST),Austin Byrd,"It wouldn&#39;t completely destroy production, but it would ever degrade it. People are still investing, they&#39;re just not investing based on prices. Not based on market demands. So people will produce, or attempt to, in areas where they&#39;re not demanded. They use time, effort, and real scarce resources in areas where we don&#39;t want/need it. This specifically hurts us on the world stage, especially compared to sound countries like the scandinavian ones. The only way to fix this stagflation is to raise rates, in which case you collapse the whole house of cards."
13611,Negative Interest Rates DESTRUCTIVE Powers Explained: (SIMPLE & FAST),Shu Shirakawa,I as a corporation borrow $1 billion at -5% then I do what? Let it sit in a bank account with -5%? No. Buy back shares? What are the investors going to do? Sit on money with -5% interest? No. They are going to spend that money on something that maintains its value. i.e. there will be a shift towards durable goods. The problem is that certain types of durable goods like land make the cost of living more expensive. You would either tax the land directly or put a 0% floor on mortgages. Saving in money will be gone which means people will be forced to keep their wealth in the real world.

One wouldn&#39;t mind so much if everyone got that interest and it was not just the preserve or inferred right of the privatised bank to own it.

13692,Consumer Price Index: Biggest Scam In US History Revealed!,George Gammon,"PLEASE NOTE: When I talk about the tax brackets I mention I&#39;m using the marginal rate as the effective rate for the sake of simplicity.  It is true, your entire income isn&#39;t taxed at your top marginal rate.  Thx!"
13693,Consumer Price Index: Biggest Scam In US History Revealed!,fitzbeke,Can you or someone else here please explain why the salary increased from 48k to 52k if the government is saying there’s no inflation? Idk if I’m missing something. Would that happen based on the real inflation?
13694,Consumer Price Index: Biggest Scam In US History Revealed!,Pong,"It&#39;s a HUGE difference though: if you calculate the tax for $52K correctly, it would be $8k, a $800 increase from the $7.2K tax for $48K income, comparing to the $5.8k increase you claimed. For &quot;the sake of simplicity,&quot; you helped spread one of the most common misinformation about tax brackets and magnified the difference by a whopping 625% ((5800-800)/800*100%).<br>Also, not so convinced by your argument that one has to either believe that the either current inflation is higher than it&#39;s presented or 1970s&#39;s inflation is much exaggerated. Your argument was based on the key that when measuring the CPI from 1970s and now using the old method (&quot;same ruler&quot;), the numbers would be pretty much the same. That argument can be easily disputed by claiming that it&#39;s meaningless to measure anything using the old method since it&#39;s wrong/flawed. A broken scale that always shows 10lbs would tell that the weight of an elephant and the weight of an ant are the same. A more meaningful comparison, if possible, would be CPIs of 1970s and now both using the current calculation method. If those numbers come out to be similar as well, that would be a much more convincing argument. <br>Aside from these two points, I liked the video. Would love to know more about the story behind why cost of homes was excluded from the CPI. It&#39;s particularly relative now since the home prices have been increase much more dramatically than rental cost lately."

Based on an accurate application of the US tax system, the new tax bill would be $8,000, not $13,000. Thus, the taxpayer would have more take home pay following the salary boost than before (which is the opposite of what George says). Again, George raises interesting points before this in the video, but making such an obvious error just to prove his main point makes me wonder how many other times he uses &#39;simplicity&#39; to make assumptions that validate his views."

13714,Consumer Price Index: Biggest Scam In US History Revealed!,KingOfMadCows,"But how would you create an inflation calculation that can account for changes in product quality and technology? For example, computers and electronics improve very fast. Your smartphone cpu is more powerful than a pc cpu from 10 years ago. A 50 inch flat screen TV was $7,000 when they first came out, 5 years later, the price went down to $2,000, now you can get one of better quality for $400. <br><br>How would you properly weigh the things that do get much cheaper due to improvements in technology and manufacturing methods with the things that have stable prices or prices that go up.<br><br>Also, how would you account for the power of advertising? Many brands are built on powerful advertising campaigns. Like in the Crest toothpaste example, many brand products are no better than generic products. Heck, pretty much all bottled water uses tap water. People buy them because they have advertising, they pay stores and online vendors to put their products in more visible areas."

13722,Repo Market: Is The Crisis Getting Worse? (ANSWER REVEALED!),HansGuitarSolo,Thanks for the info George great video as usual. I’m confused about one thing. You mentioned in this video and others that the purpose of the repo transactions are for banks to make sure they have the reserves they are required to have. At the end of this video you gave an example of a lending institution borrowing a million to make home loans and then rolling that over with repo operations over the course of 10 years while their debtors pay it back. I’m assuming though they are going to make a loan many times more than the million dollars they borrowed due to the hokey fractional nature of our bank g system. For instance they might lend 10 million from the 1 million they borrowed. The other 9 is created on the spot. Is this right or am I missing something? Thanks!

13833,Repo Market Crisis: Is This Next Lehman Bros. Moment?,Kay Bass,"A banking/financial meltdown in the EU, with the loss of the Euro and a Lehman squared event, is identified as the crisis arriving in the US like a shower of insolvency; arriving at the very inconvenient time when the US, Israel and allies are having a WAR with Iran. Daniel 11: 44, 45 Daniel 8: 20, 23-25. Prosecuting a major WAR while MELTING DOWN due to a crisis arriving from Europe....is a MAJOR BUMMER.  This time of crisis, the Sunrise of God&#39;s arrived Kingdom Malachi 4: 2 is described in prophetic Scripture in incredible detail. WE know what will happen. MY comments all describe some aspect of the arrival of the end of the present system Romans 9: 28 and the arrival of God&#39;s Kingdom Matthew 6: 9. Click my name, subscribe, and see what the Scriptures say about these days."
13834,Repo Market Crisis: Is This Next Lehman Bros. Moment?,Kay Bass,"The time of financial meltdown arrives Psalms 46: 4-6 and this is the &#39;Sunrise&#39; of the arrival of God&#39;s Kingdom, that also includes the arrival of wars and wrath. So a banking system meltdown in the EU causes a crisis that is Lehman squared; and sends a wave of insolvency crises world wide. This causes the loss of the Euro; and also immediately causes the fainting of the Australian dollar and banking system, before the fire crisis in Australia is resolved. At the same time, the Sunrise of God&#39;s Kingdom, with Christ&#39;s arrival &#39;in power and great glory&#39; Matthew 24: 29, 30 includes a war appearing between the US, Israel, allies and IRAN. So the BOMBING of Israel by Iran Daniel 11: 44, 45 also mentions the &#39;Sunrise&#39; as well. The &#39;kings from the rising of the Sun&#39; Revelation 16: 12 Jehovah God, and Christ Jesus are both involved in this period of prophecy. <br>This is also a time of protests and riots. This is seen in prophecy in Daniel 2: 31-46. The &#39;iron-like&#39; totalitarian governments are not &#39;mixing&#39; with the clay-like ordinary people. This world-wide situation, of protests and riots are seen in 30 countries, including protests in the Czech Republic today.  These 30 countries are:<br>Spain, Sudan, Russia, Egypt, Uganda, Indonesia, Ukraine, Peru, Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Colombia, France, Turkey, Venezuela, The Netherlands, Ethiopia, Brazil, Malawi, Algeria, Iraq, Haiti, Ecuador, Lebanon, Chile, Guinea, Pakistan, Bolivia, Iran, Georgia and Prague.<br>These have taken protesting and rioting to an extreme in Q4 of 2019. This comes at a time of a gradually saddening world economy, and the reactions of the governments have been to squeeze the people with increased taxes, rising prices, and reduced assistance. People see corruption, and have risen up in many places  at one time<br>Daniel&#39;s prophecy CONTINUES with the arrival of a &#39;Stone&#39;, Christ Jesus, that impacts this political &#39;image&#39; at it feet of iron and clay, and the political image is DESTROYED. The &#39;Stone&#39;, Christ Jesus, arriving in Kingdom power as also seen in Matthew 24: 29, 30 then becomes &#39;a large mountain that fills the earth&#39;.  God&#39;s Kingdom on earth Daniel 2: 44 takes over the welfare of the faithful John 3: 16 the meek Psalms 37: 11 and the righteous Psalms 37: 20 who are all found inside God&#39;s Kingdom as &#39;sheep-like&#39; ones at the time of Christ&#39;s arrival. Matthew 25: 31, 34.<br>These events that are all  described in the time of the &#39;Sunrise&#39; Malachi 4: 2 ARE all visible, so how far away is this Sunrise? It is IMMINENT."

I am hearing that landlords will get grants from government to cover lost revenue. Also banks are going to forgive mortgage payments up to a year. But what happens after a year? Do banks want back pay? Do they restructure the loans with missed payments? Will they forgive interest on the loans during that period? Some critical data of whats going on with regulation in the real estate sector and possible out comes in the near and long term future of real estate based on whats going on now would be appreciated. <br><br><br>I sold my home in 2019 and been sitting on cash waiting for this opportunity to jump back in.

13917,Housing Bubble: Undeniable Proof Revealed!,George Gammon,"Clarification:  I used the old chart of savings rate from FRED intentionally.  I researched the rationale for the adjustments made that brought the savings rate up substantially.  It was ridiculous, the premise was the IRS claimed people weren&#39;t claiming enough income so savings rates had to be higher.  What you&#39;ll notice about the IRS is they always try to factor in lower payments into their models but they never account for overpayments.  And Americans vastly overpay on net balance.  So bottom line, the old chart is much more reflective of reality and that&#39;s why I used it."

13924,Housing Bubble: Undeniable Proof Revealed!,Mr Eric,"Great explanation throughout your Vids, thanks:) Strange that the price to income per capita fell from 1950-2000!"
13925,Housing Bubble: Undeniable Proof Revealed!,NegatingSilence,"What if people just spend a lot more of their income on housing than before? This has been going on for as far back as the charts go--price/income just keeps going up. If it&#39;s been going up since 15 years before I was born, then waiting for it to correct seems futile."
13926,Housing Bubble: Undeniable Proof Revealed!,Трайковски,"George, you are missing something. The percentage of ownership has changed. Now less people own a house than before. So they have to rent. This drives the demand higher for rental properties, which  drives house prices higher. So here I have the argument that if 10 percent own all rental properties, supply, the others 90 percent create a demand. The higher the inequality, the higher the demand for the property, the higher the price. After paying the rent, less income to save for downpayment. So it is becoming more difficult for the working class to escape from the rat&#39;s race. The rich do no sell."
13927,Housing Bubble: Undeniable Proof Revealed!,PKShingdaz,Population expanded quicker than wages could. To meet that demand Mortgage loans became a very expensive credit card whereby the payments are never really paid off. <br><br><br><br>This in turn leads / results into a Ponzi scheme &gt; as future buyers become risk takers that they will get a payout before the money runs out.

13929,Housing Bubble: Undeniable Proof Revealed!,Rob Santa Ana CA,"The investor component has not been factored in. All cash and they turn homes into rentals. Decreases supply, raises prices, interest rates artificially low and will be kept there for a long time, we have quite awhile before any reversion and if we get low again cash rich investors will buy where it makes sense to rent. Owners will be renters"

13941,Housing Bubble: Undeniable Proof Revealed!,Dynamo Dan,"House prices are underpinned by mean household income.  Mean house prices should be no more than x4 mean household income.  Mean household income for central Toronto is $90k.  Multiply by 4 equals $360k.  That should be a healthy level for mean house prices.  Unfortunately mean house prices in TO are $830k.  Which means that house prices are running at a multiple of 9 times.  Yep, your in a bubble.  If you want to know the sustainable price for real estate in any market, just find out average household income and  times by 4."

I&#39;m looking forward to a pullback and/or correction so I can buy on the cheap.  Mr. Gammon and other Perma Bears want a world from the past, but those days are over for a long time now.  The real power is technology and information, not commodities, real estate is important but you better know what you are doing, and technology and information are involved heavily.  Now, of course, you think technology and information will suddenly go away, by all means, get gold, but it won&#39;t.  Even Buffett owns a lot of Apple.  Because one wants something to happen based on their own worldview doesn&#39;t mean it will happen.   I enjoy Mr. Gammon&#39;s bearishness."

13995,My Investing Principles: 3 Steps To Build Wealth & Thrive,mark alexander,George Gammon can you do a video on long term real estate investing outside of the US and dive into age demographic data. I.e. US isn’t repopulating as fast as we used too. Baby boomers are liquidating. What countries have low cost per sq foot and you see having a thriving economy over the next 10-50 years. Where can we diversify out of US dollar with real estate?

If what your saying is correct that one bank is insolvent if the fed prints enough money it won&#39;t matter as long as the other banks are in good health. So basically the fed can do what they need to. To keep the whole thing going. I just don&#39;t see the fed that&#39;s going to allow the economy to collapse or am I missing something.

If the bank that you&#39;re giving the cash to goes bankrupt you simply keep their bond. Furthermore, it&#39;s not unreasonable to think that the large bond sales done by the Fed (QT) were responsible for decreasing the cash in the system to the point where it eventually became a problem.

The rules that I cant evict made my tenants who where &quot;ok&quot; into abusive tenants. I could not and I still cant evict until may 29th in Florida. In two months of the government telling my tenants that no matter what they do I cant evict them resulted in one of them going to jail for planting a pipe bomb, code enforcement issues, and a violent knife assault against another tenant. Code enforcement can still charge me $50 per day but my tools to deal with issues have been taken away. I am done with low income. Those people can go live in tents in the woods. If the unit does not rent for at least $1200 then I want nothing to do with it. The people I know in the business agree.

14058,Housing Bubble 2 0 - MORE Warning Signs Revealed!,James Campbell,"I looked into buy mortgage notes as an investment and I was shocked to find out how many people (millions) are living in their house and have not paid a penny on their mortgage for years...as many as 9 years since the housing bubble of 2008.  The banks started to foreclose on many houses but that depressed the housing market even more and neighborhoods were left deserted (Detroit and St. Louis for example).  The FED wants to keep the illusion of a strong housing market so they don&#39;t foreclose, which in turn allows people to buy cars and other goods as they&#39;re not paying a mortgage.  It really is the everything bubble.  In a way I&#39;m a little envious that I&#39;m not one of those people living for free in one of those houses.  I also read that there are millions of people doing the same thing in Spain and when they started to foreclose on some of them early this year then a route broke out."

14068,Housing Market: Buy Now Or Wait For Crash...ANSWERED!,cabdolla,"This video did not age well, and the premise is highly speculative. First of all, there is a shortage of houses across the United States. In 2008, builders were making new homes left and right on speculation. That is not happening today. Second, if you think houses are &quot;overpriced&quot; by 50%, then you need to look at the cost to build a new house in construction material and land value. That is the rock bottom price one could build a home. Material prices are though the roof right now. Please justify how you arrived at a magical 50% drop. It&#39;s nonsense. I like your channel, its very interesting. But you were clearly wrong on this one. Furthermore, real estate is more complicated than what you have on this simple example. You need to look at net migration inflows and outflows and macro and micro economic scales to see what areas are going up, and what areas are going down. This is not real investing advice, in the slightest."

14071,Housing Market: Buy Now Or Wait For Crash...ANSWERED!,Angela J,"We have no  guarantee of a 50% crash, especially not in all markets; some might just flatline instead of their usual annual increases.  There are tight markets people are still moving into that have not seen drops in prices.  The Fed printing might cause a lot of inflation, and that would make it&#39;s way into housing also.  Add the cost of the rent you spent into your negative numbers on the houses.  I live in a small dark not fancy apt, the rent is nearly $2000, in 30 years if I always rented, I would have spent $720k, which would even out your figures.  We all gotta live somewhere."

This system I am using in Turkey and made a fortune on a shoestring..  So my motto .. Never rent but buy a house with a fixed rate loan  and  NEVER BUY ALL CASH DOWN HOUSE  ..

But the thing is, that nightmare was more interesting and made more sense.  What the hell were you talking about. Real estate is your bag, and you butchered this topic. It was of no help at all. George, you got to stop yourself from playing with your calculator while using meth. <br>Give the short answer,  No, the economy is on fire, hold off for the next down cycle. If we ask you what time it is, you will tell us how to build the whole clock. Who needs that much ridiculous math, nobody.<br>Long answer, everyone should first educate themselves, then buy real estate anytime you can find a great deal!  In every economy there are fools giving away homes at the wrong prices and you can find great deals. But you can find 100x better deals when the economy tanks and folks are throwing everything out the airplane window including the kitchen sink which is still attached to their house. <br>For the record, I love your educational skill set, your gift of gab,  ive watched most of your videos.

It’s the absolute truth. Quick story... my bro’s in-laws had stoped paying their mortgage a couple years back. As in your video the bank never gave them a final Eviction date/Notice. I remember my sister in law telling me about her parents situation,  and when I asked how long It had been she said  it was going on almost 2 years. Me at the time having no interest in any markets or even knowing how the system actually worked told myself that it was absolutely impossible for her parents to still be living in the Home if it had been that long without a payment. Absolutely incredible knowledge. Thinking back to when exactly this was I’m going to guess around 2013. Just several years after the Collapse. Amazing. <br>Thank you fro the video.

14103,Housing Bubble 2.0 - Shocking New Red Flags Revealed,Drewman416,Andy Ho with all respect who the heck buys a house with 15 other investors?? I can understand a small family. E.g. A single mother with 3 adult children all have 5 or less years out of high school. Mother gets the mortgage in her name and buys a 4 bedroom home instead of throwing money away on Rent. Her kids give her money (rent)  for living there and help her to own the home. I’m not saying what you said doesn’t happen. Maybe group of buddies buy home and split the mortgage or all investors throw in 10-20k each and sit back and collect the rent. I hope I’m not coming off as close minded. I’m not sure how you guys live out there in the Rockies but here in NY lower Hudson valley 60 min out of NYC I’ve never heard of such a situation as you are describing. Sounds ridiculous. Maybe you’re being blatantly sarcastic and I’m taking you seriously. Hahaha please explain cause I’d like to get into a low risk- decent reward investment like that

If the asset prices plummet, the pension system collapses and Raoul Pal&#39;s doom loop plays out. Just wondering how long this can go on.. Perhaps, as has already been demonstrated, for a lot longer than we can imagine.

How can that be mal-investment? Those jobs are in the real economy providing real income to the drivers as long as they have custom base that can afford their services. Free money is always money that is created from nothing as a deposit created at a bank which we call a loan or debt. The law calls it a bank deposit, a deposit owned by the bank yet created from nothing by said privatised bank! I would say the problem may well emulate from the fact that the bank owns the deposit. Who should own the deposit? All of us should own the deposit. Pension  funds benefit from QE in rapid share rises rather than income payments, again they are for the super rich. Most  will be on state pensions with exhausted savings  which are not investment funds, they are simply figures written to accounts"

14164,What Is This Channel All About?  And How Will It Benefit You?,Michael Klein,"You answered my point from my comments on Rent Control. I am a disabled person. However, I have a wealth of an analytical mind with a passion not real estate involved. However, real estate unchecked has significant impacts my passion. I can and will share this with you, if interested. With that said, I have lightly been involved in Real Estate since 2011, invested in Financial Education with Robert Kyosaki  at that time. Teachings were very good and helped bring me to a point of personal debt free. But remodeling, flips, etc of brick and mortar was not my interest. So, I have settled in the &#39;paper&#39; side of buildings and found in much more rewarding to focus on being the bank and not concerned with the 3 &#39;Ts&#39; - Toilets, Trash, and Termites. However, not understanding all the potential strategies of build (brick and mortar), the paper side is worthless.

14177,How Rent Control Destroys A City AND Hurts Renters!,Michael Klein,"I agree George that rent control can be problematic. In the states because of there are many many gov&#39;t programs. Sadly programs, i.e. Social Security, should not have ever taken place. Yet playing the Devil&#39;s Advocate, once a person reaches an age that working is no longer possible or those who have disabilities, most sadly are on &#39;fixed income&#39;. I landlords charge whatever they wish, yes these low renters must move out. Because lots of people have not had proper financial education, they do not immediately no where to turn and if you look at most major cities in the world, there is and will always be low housing districts, homelessness, which can and has devalued adjacent areas. All rich have taught that homelessness will always be there. Sadly in mine and your lifetime, this will not change. Gov&#39;t programs will not change and sadly will likely increase&#39; causing more taxes to be paid by those desiring to get out the &#39;class&#39; they are in. I and many wish reality is not present. My primary discomfort of not having rent control is disabled veterans though no reason other than they helped protect their country and most have limited income. Yes, some have succeeded. but even they have not (for the most part) reached out to other disabled to teach them how to get past their current &#39;class&#39;.<br>The only remedy, is remove all forms of gov&#39;t, let the markets really be free. As I sad earlier, this will not happen in mine or your lifetime"

14180,How Rent Control Destroys A City AND Hurts Renters!,Bubblewatch,"I am a rent control tenant in SF from 2009. My rent is maybe  half current market. The crazy thing that has happened as my family grew, I was able to keep the property to use sparingly as a second property. Landlord is stuck w sub market rent. Someone who would gladly pay double is artificially locked out while it deteriorates as landlord has cut maintenance. Sublease prohibited so I’ve been hanging on waiting for a correction. If things do crash then the landlord will probably get locked into a new tenant at the bottom of the rent cycle for many years again after I finally leave."
14181,How Rent Control Destroys A City AND Hurts Renters!,carsonc29,"IMO, the people who are against rent control are the land lords, people with higher incomes who arent affected by the rent increases, and people who invest heavily in rental properties..none of those people have ever had to open up a letter telling them their rent has doubled or even tripled..people can barely save for retirement or save at all..not to mention the ridiculous cost in health care.... and you want to double someones rent just because you put a new washer/dryer in?!!! TF!!!! i mean seriously, something has to give..cant just keep raising the price of everything while wages continue to be stagnant..I dont know how it is anywhere else, but in my area, the only new apartments they build are luxury..rents for 1 bed rooms can easily go above $1000 per month..thats a lot for my area..when apartment rent prices begin to mirror mortgages for houses, then there is a serious issue..at some point, we are gonna have to stop being so concerned about investor returns and adopt a more moral code to capitalism....what good does it do to raise rent prices to improve profit if those buildings end up vacant???"

14279,Dave Ramsey Is Wrong: Ignores Housing Bubble 2.0! 😱,Diego Lara,"Everyone keeps saying its a bubble and they use 2008 as an example. People don&#39;t even know why the 2008 bubble happen. It was due to people qualifying for variable loans that they could not afford. Even if the homes are higher priced right now, the people buying them are those that can afford them. They are either buying them cash and those that are getting mortgage loans are qualifying through higher borrowing standards than in 2008. Even if the home values go down it does not affect the mortgage payment. House prices may go down but mortgages remain the same. In 2008 peoples mortgage went up after a couple of years because of the junk loans they were giving out, and they couldnt sell their homes because home prices dropped. There is no comparison to 2008 at all. The only thing that can happen is that inventory will go down and prices will therefore drop due to supply and demand. But those already in their home will remain in their home."

14301,The Housing Market: Are Prices Going Up Or Down?,Patrick Sullivan,"Very Interesting!  Denver -- Pop Change will likely increase.  Cap flows neutral.  Supply costs - won&#39;t they stay similar to current levels?  There is plenty of land available and I don&#39;t think building codes are burdensome.  Real wages should follow national trends or be a bit better (so neutral or down).  Rates and credit - huge downward pressure as elsewhere in the US.  Overall, despite the exorbitant increases in prices compared to historical levels, it seems that only rates/credit will put downward pressure on house prices.  Would you agree?"

14308,The Housing Market: Are Prices Going Up Or Down?,Dennis Arzubiaga,I think prices in the 90019 zip code which is the Los Angeles area will increase due to increased demand to live in the city as opposed to the suburbs where workers have to travel to the city because that’s where the economic power is at and where the jobs are at. Increased travel time on the 60 freeway going from East to west will make workers want to live in Los Angeles and make things even more groovy for the ones who stuck it out in the city.

14363,Housing bubble 2.0 (Why And When It'll Crash),T T,"Sadly, normal people have to compete with big money corporations and rich domestic and foreign buyers/investors. The middle class will only continue to struggle. As long as the Fed continues to control and artificially inflate the market with Infinity and Beyond fiat money things will continue to go up. How can they raise interest rates? It will only hurt their friends in the stock market. There will always be corporations and people with tons of cash to drive prices up. This is the world we live in now. Nothing is fair or makes sense. There is all this push for &quot;affordable housing&quot; which is subsidized by the government. Why? Because the American Dream is dead. The Fed knows this and they don&#39;t care. If so, they would put regulations on second home buyers and foreign investors, freeing up housing for the people who actually work and need a place to live. History and logic no longer apply. America citizens no longer matter. It&#39;s what is good for the Elite."

14368,Housing bubble 2.0 (Why And When It'll Crash),Stefano Di Romualdo,The house supply is not always depending on the home builders interest. I think that very often is more likely to be dependent on the public authorities policies which usually back the interest of the owners to keep the prices growing or at least stable

Didn&#39;t talk about the lack of supply in housing we have. I think if these &quot;Funds&quot; cash in on their property portfolios we might have a normalization of prices not a decline.

14420,Pension Crisis Time Bomb: Find Out If You're At Risk?,Tacit Dionysus,"An excellent and lucid explanation.<br><br>It&#39;s interesting to see the difference between the US system and The Australian system. What you are describing is like our &#39;old system&#39; of Superannuation (retirement benefits) using &#39;defined benefits schemes&#39;. In other words a person can calculate exactly how much they will be getting based on years of service and average final salary. You can&#39;t get into those any more, although quite a few older workers still remain in legacy systems because they&#39;re &#39;generous&#39;. They were discontinued from the late 80s because they were seen as financially unsustainable for the reasons you explain. They&#39;ve also introduced some new rules to modify them so that, after retirement, the benefits will now work more like the newer accumulation funds.<br><br>These days Superannuation uses &#39;accumulation account&#39; schemes. In other words, your employer has to put in a certain amount based on a percentage of your salary. You can also make extra personal contributions (either taken out before tax or after; your choice). That amount is invested (you can choose what sort of investments you want, ranging through options from low risk low return, to higher risk higher growth) and what you get paid on retirement is the amount you put in, plus what it returned in investments, minus 15% tax on what it earned and a few percent in management fees). In other words, what you get out of it is based on what your contributions actually earned. You are sharing in the risk, so you have a strong stake in how well the economy is going, but the risk of it being &#39;unfunded&#39; is somewhat eliminated. You can take Super earlier than retirement in the event of disability, serious illness, etc.<br><br>I started paying into Super on the cusp of the 80s changes, so I was in a hybrid scheme. Most of it was from an accumulation fund, but some came from a small defined benefit component and from a 3% wage rise that the union voted to be paid into Super instead of given immediately to people as wages. When I retired that scheme was closed and all my benefits were transferred into a fund which works like a &#39;modern&#39; accumulation benefit fund. I pay no tax on my Super income (I already paid tax when it was accumulating when I was employed). I can still work if I want (I do some part time work 3 days a week). I can withdraw any of my funds as a lump sum (I paid off what was left of my home mortgage doing that) and I can allocate any of my funds to provide regular payments (based, at my age, on a minimum of 5% per year of my remaining funds).<br><br>I estimate my Super payments will last at least 20 years if the economy stays stable but maybe only half that at the same living standard in the event of a severe recession (probably starting in the USA). Once my assets and income get down to a certain level I can claim a part (federal) pension and pharmaceutical benefits. As it declines further I can gradually get a full pension (basically just enough to live very minimally), but I don&#39;t think I will be around that long. <br><br>The idea behind Super is that people can self-fund their retirement at least to some degree. Not everyone chooses to put in extra contributions, but I&#39;m glad I did, even though it was hard at the time with a mortgage as well. Superannuation funds are run by banks, industry groups and some individual employers (e.g. state governments) and you can stay with your existing fund if you change jobs. Alternatively, if you can set up your own Super fund, with all the same rules and benefits, and control your investments personally. <br><br>It surprises me that the US system is so &#39;socialist&#39; and the Australian system so comparatively &#39;capitalist&#39; in their principles, even though the latter was originally set up by a Labor (more socialist oriented) government. I guess everything really is upside down here."

14478,Are We In Another Real Estate Bubble?  5 Reasons You Should Be Terrified,Aileen Harkwood,"The one factor you haven&#39;t addressed is the movement into home buying by equity firms that have been buying up massive numbers of properties since the crash. This is a relatively new phenomenon, which is also partly responsible for the rents increasing far beyond what people can reasonably be expected to pay. It seems like if they were to crash again or even just hint at crashing, that these same vulture capitalists will simply swoop in and suck up all the properties they can, adding them to their portfolios. Thus, they prop up the real estate sector. The people at the top are looking for hard assets that can bring in a guaranteed cash flow in the event we lose dollar hegemony."
14479,Are We In Another Real Estate Bubble?  5 Reasons You Should Be Terrified,happy bubbles,"What&#39;s worse is that a huge percentage of these properties are not even being rented out, many sit vacant.

I am a very successful &quot;Buy and Hold&quot; real estate investor and I want to buy a property in Bogota and eventually in Medellin.  I had a realtor in Bogota tell me that there are no mortgages for foreigners.  He said that you have to buy the properties using cash only; that is supposedly what all of the foreigners do. But now that I see this video,  I am wondering if there is another lender who can provide long term financing ?  I know that Chris is a hard money lender, but is there anyone you recommend for financing?   - Julio -"

14544,Macro Real Estate Investing Show: How inflation fools investors,Patrick Ruff,@George Gammon I guess the counterpoint is that home price when adjusted for inflation may be flat but if you have cash flow from rent and a 30 yr. mortgage the bank is eating some of the inflation for you. I know you know that but I think alot of people don&#39;t.

14574,Best Tip For Real Estate Investing Beginners,PublicEye,Can you tell us how to deal with US tax while investing RE in Colombia?  Thank you in advance.
14575,Best Tip For Real Estate Investing Beginners,George Gammon,"As a US citizen you pay the US on worldwide income.  Colombian sourced income would be taxed in CO, then you&#39;d get a credit towards the tax you owe the US on that same income.  So you wouldn&#39;t be taxed twice.  <br><br>That said, I&#39;m not a tax expert.  This has been my experience but you&#39;d want to check with a tax pro to make sure."
14576,Best Tip For Real Estate Investing Beginners,jesus blazquez,"Hi George - I hope you are well in MDE. I have watched your videos and they have given me great insight to the market in MDE. Most of the lessons you teach can be applied to any market in any country. I have a question for you, can you please elaborate on the compensation the real estate agents earn in MDE. Is it similar to the 3% earned by the sellers agent in the U.S.?"
14577,Best Tip For Real Estate Investing Beginners,George Gammon,"Jesus, thx for the question.  In Colombia there&#39;s  3% commission paid in total, so the agents split the 3%.  It&#39;s similar to the amount agents make in the US because most agents work on their own (not with brokers.)  Like everything this can be negotiated but 1.5% for the buyers agent and 1.5% for the sellers agent, with no broker involved, is the standard.  <br><br><br>And yes, 99% of what I talk about on the channel can be applied to RE investing any where in the world.  I&#39;ve actually done far more buy/remodel/flips in the US than overseas. ;)"

14596,Medellin Real Estate Investing Vlog: Episode #1 Colombia Moda,Rodolfo Vitangcol,"Billion Dollar Income Potential in Ruvol<br><br>I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting to play than CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  <br><br>Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” <br><br>Why am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  I found chess to be so repetitive that any clever player could easily master the moves to a point they could even play against opponents blindfolded.  It is for this reason I invented a game where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play. <br><br>Since Ruvol is yet “unpublished,” I am extra careful in fully disclosing how it is exactly played, lest it might be “plagiarized.”  The “BEST PREVIEW” I can give, more than enough to appreciate how the game is played, is as follows:<br><br>1.	Ruvol is almost somewhat played like chess.  [I invented Ruvol primarily to give chess a direct “apple-to-apple” competition.] <br>2.	Like chess, Ruvol is a board game for two players.<br>3.	If the chess board is square in shape containing 64 squares in all, the Ruvol board is rectangular with more number of squares in it.<br>4.	If each chess player has 16 pieces, each Ruvol player has equal number of pieces as well.<br>5.	If each type of chess piece moves in a distinct way, the Ruvol types of pieces move in distinct ways, too. <br>6.	If to win the chess game requires tactical skills or strategic thinking, the more the Ruvol requires of it.<br>7.	If the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent’s king, the way to win Ruvol is entirely different but far more exciting and challenging.    <br><br>In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  These 800 million players comprise the “Total Potential Buyers” of Ruvol across the globe.  At an average profit of just US$5 per set, the “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol then is US$4 billion.  Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale is US$40M.<br><br>I AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL.  <br><br>For the reason that I don’t have the money to produce, distribute, and market Ruvol in a global scale, I find it “wiser” to simply sell my copyright.  <br><br>If you are interested to buy my copyright, email me your BEST PRICE OFFER.  Or if you know someone willing to buy my copyright, you are entitled to a 10% commission.<br><br>On the other hand, if you have a “much better option” in mind than what I am proposing here, don’t hesitate to let me know.<br><br>Thanks and God bless.<br> <br>RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL<br>The Ruvol Inventor<br><br>rodolfovitangcol@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>"

14622,Top 5 Reasons To Invest In Real Estate,TheCa007,"Great video, thank you. I’m learning so much from you. I have a question, when you’re developing your score on what area, price, and pop growth etc. What websites or programs are you using to compile your information, so you can make the best choices? i saw your video about it, but a more specific maybe 4 -8 part series about how to develop the data, read, comprehend, and put the information into action, would be truly helpful for a newbie like myself. Thank you."
14623,Top 5 Reasons To Invest In Real Estate,Gia B,Hi George! I have a two family home .  I’ve owned it for 10 years for years. My rental income has gone up from $3000 a month to 4500 monthly. I am leaving to Puerto Rico. So I’m selling the property. To build my beachfront  Villa. Long story short .  My rental property over the course of 10 years made me tens of thousands of dollars over the years. once I sell it I will have made close to $1 million.
14624,Top 5 Reasons To Invest In Real Estate,chummaker1,"Whoa!  Not so fast George, I do like your show but the same faults that you find in other assets, you find in real estate.  How much control do you have over hurricanes, floods, fires, break-ins, termites, dry rot, etc., HOA, property taxes, who moves in next door, what you think will increase the value of the property another person may not, and may even consider the &quot;improvement&quot; a detriment.  The true &quot;value&quot; of a property is many times skewed by &quot;perception&quot; of the individual.  Perception many times determines that property on a certain side of the street is more valuable than property across  the street.  The value of property is NOT determined by property tax values or appraisals but by what a ready willing an able Buyer and a ready willing and able Seller will except.  Nothing else.  Regarding the idea that gold and silver costs you to keep, don&#39;t forget the houses, buildings, raw land, and even horses, cattle, hogs, airplanes, etc ALL require some form of maintenance be it vet bills, painting, plumbing, etc.  As far as increasing your equity or ROI on a property by putting down a down payment of $10,000 on $100,000 house you also gain a $90,000 liability.  Considering Property Taxes, HOA taxes and requirements, maintenance, management of property, book keeping, building permits, government anti-discrimination and disability laws.  The cost of gold and silver is minor or maybe ZERO if you take possession of it.  And you should cause if YOU AIN&quot;T GOT IT, YOU AIN&#39;T GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

14657,Top 5 Reasons To Invest In Medellin Real Estate,Diego lasso,"I don&#39;t get it , why I&#39;m gonna invest in a cheap currency when I can invest in dollars ? Why you want to down grade you portfolio like that , Even if you plan to retire in colombia invest in u.s dollars . The math is simple y&#39;all."
14658,Top 5 Reasons To Invest In Medellin Real Estate,Crypto Guapo,@Cristhian Morales 10 years ago the Peso was 1.75 vs the Dollar...if u invest ur Dollar now and the Pesos strengths later u will get a crazy return
14659,Top 5 Reasons To Invest In Medellin Real Estate,Cristhian Morales,"Simple, if you are investing 60k dollars in a house in Colombia with a really inflated dollar and the dollar loses power ( which since you are here I think we can agree it will) then you bought an asset with an inflated currency and can sell it when the peso increase to its historic trend in comparison to the dollar. It’s just like buying gold when the dollar is strong, holding it and selling it when Gold prize is really high. He said it Btw this is just about diversifying your portfolio. I actually bough a loot in Colombia for $25k and built for $35k. The funny part is that I can now sell that house for somewhere between $100k to $130k and the dollar hasn’t even lost its value, that’s just what I made from the construction and how much the area where I bought has increased in value. I’d say in general buying commodities with such an inflated currency as the dollar is right now is always a good move as long as you diversify."

14662,Top 5 Reasons To Invest In Medellin Real Estate,Rodolfo Vitangcol,"Billion Dollar Income Potential in Ruvol<br><br>I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting to play than CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  <br><br>Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” <br><br>Why am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  I found chess to be so repetitive that any clever player could easily master the moves to a point they could even play against opponents blindfolded.  It is for this reason I invented a game where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play. <br><br>Since Ruvol is yet “unpublished,” I am extra careful in fully disclosing how it is exactly played, lest it might be “plagiarized.”  The “BEST PREVIEW” I can give, more than enough to appreciate how the game is played, is as follows:<br><br>1.	Ruvol is almost somewhat played like chess.  [I invented Ruvol primarily to give chess a direct “apple-to-apple” competition.] <br>2.	Like chess, Ruvol is a board game for two players.<br>3.	If the chess board is square in shape containing 64 squares in all, the Ruvol board is rectangular with more number of squares in it.<br>4.	If each chess player has 16 pieces, each Ruvol player has equal number of pieces as well.<br>5.	If each type of chess piece moves in a distinct way, the Ruvol types of pieces move in distinct ways, too. <br>6.	If to win the chess game requires tactical skills or strategic thinking, the more the Ruvol requires of it.<br>7.	If the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent’s king, the way to win Ruvol is entirely different but far more exciting and challenging.    <br><br>In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  These 800 million players comprise the “Total Potential Buyers” of Ruvol across the globe.  At an average profit of just US$5 per set, the “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol then is US$4 billion.  Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale is US$40M.<br><br>I AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL.  <br><br>For the reason that I don’t have the money to produce, distribute, and market Ruvol in a global scale, I find it “wiser” to simply sell my copyright.  <br><br>If you are interested to buy my copyright, email me your BEST PRICE OFFER.  Or if you know someone willing to buy my copyright, you are entitled to a 10% commission.<br><br>On the other hand, if you have a “much better option” in mind than what I am proposing here, don’t hesitate to let me know.<br><br>Thanks and God bless.<br> <br>RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL<br>The Ruvol Inventor<br><br>rodolfovitangcol@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>"

Won&#39;t the banking families make regulations worse for property owners and probably increase taxes?  The ultimate goal is to take away land from us and into their hands.

14687,Medellin Remodel Project Art Apartment: Video #1 Apartment Intro,Alsky Pearsonovich,Great video and thank you for such a organized and detailed explanation of your vision.  I have never flipped a home so I have a few amateur questions. Do you use an architect for the blueprints? Do you use an interior designer? Do you use the same contractors for all you projects? How do you determine the projected selling price? Do you use specs in the area or just an average Peso per SM to estimate the sale price? The apartment has great bones and awesome potential. Can&#39;t wait to see the results.
14688,Medellin Remodel Project Art Apartment: Video #1 Apartment Intro,George Gammon,"Thx for checking it out.  We&#39;ve actually finished demo, so I&#39;ll go over there today to shoot an update vid...stay tuned.<br><br><br>In most of South America the architect also does the general contractor duties, they&#39;re one in the same job.  So to answer your question, yes, I use an architect to figure out the floor plan.   I also have a designer (my architect and designer are a husband and wife team, I&#39;ve been using them for years).  The floor plan and interior design is really a collaborative effort with the 3 of us.  I&#39;m very involved in the decision making process.  Angie, my designer, really is only on her own when it comes to selecting furniture.  <br><br><br>Most of the subs we use are the same.  It takes a long time to build a team you can trust, but we still have to occasionally fire and rehire.  So subs are slightly fluid but architect and designer are the same. <br><br><br>So the ARV (after repair value) is determined by doing comps, like you would in the US, with the exception of MLS and zillow.  It requires that you know the area extremely well.  You need to have your finger on the pulse of exactly what apartments are trading for in xyz location.  It&#39;s why I only do flips in hyper specific areas.  <br><br><br>Thanks, I&#39;ll post vids of the whole remodel process...start to finish."
